 * SECTION:hb-subset
 * @title: hb-subset
 * @short_description: Subsets font files.
 * @include: hb-subset.h
 *
 * Subsetting reduces the codepoint coverage of font files and removes all data
 * that is no longer needed. A subset input describes the desired subset. The input is
 * provided along with a font to the subsetting operation. Output is a new font file
 * containing only the data specified in the input.
 *
 * Currently most outline and bitmap tables are supported: glyf, CFF, CFF2, sbix,
 * COLR, and CBDT/CBLC. This also includes fonts with variable outlines via OpenType
 * variations. Notably EBDT/EBLC and SVG are not supported. Layout subsetting is supported
 * only for OpenType Layout tables (GSUB, GPOS, GDEF). Notably subsetting of graphite or AAT tables
 * is not yet supported.
 *
 * Fonts with graphite or AAT tables may still be subsetted but will likely need to use the
 * retain glyph ids option and configure the subset to pass through the layout tables untouched.
