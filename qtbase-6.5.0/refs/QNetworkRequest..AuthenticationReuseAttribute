<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/network/access/qnetworkrequest.cpp' l='220'>\value AuthenticationReuseAttribute
        Requests only, type: QMetaType::Int (default: QNetworkRequest::Automatic)
        Indicates whether to use cached authorization credentials in the request,
        if available. If this is set to QNetworkRequest::Manual and the authentication
        mechanism is &apos;Basic&apos; or &apos;Digest&apos;, Qt will not send an an &apos;Authorization&apos; HTTP
        header with any cached credentials it may have for the request&apos;s URL.
        This attribute is set to QNetworkRequest::Manual by Qt WebKit when creating a cross-origin
        XMLHttpRequest where withCredentials has not been set explicitly to true by the
        Javascript that created the request.
        See \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/#credentials-flag} {here} for more information.
