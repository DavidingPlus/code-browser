<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/network/access/qnetworkrequest.cpp' l='303'>\value Http2CleartextAllowedAttribute
        Requests only, type: QMetaType::Bool (default: false)
        If set, this attribute will tell QNetworkAccessManager to attempt
        an upgrade to HTTP/2 over cleartext (also known as h2c).
        Until Qt 7 the default value for this attribute can be overridden
        to true by setting the QT_NETWORK_H2C_ALLOWED environment variable.
        This attribute is ignored if the Http2AllowedAttribute is not set.
        (This value was introduced in 6.3.)</doc>
