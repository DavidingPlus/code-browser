  Retrieves the previous record in the result, if available, and
  positions the query on the retrieved record. Note that the result
  must be in the \l{isActive()}{active} state and isSelect() must
  return true before calling this function or it will do nothing and
  return false.

  The following rules apply:

  \list

  \li If the result is currently located before the first record, there
  is no change and false is returned.

  \li If the result is currently located after the last record, an
  attempt is made to retrieve the last record.

  \li If the result is somewhere in the middle, an attempt is made to
  retrieve the previous record.

  \endlist

  If the record could not be retrieved, the result is positioned
  before the first record and false is returned. If the record is
  successfully retrieved, true is returned.

  \sa next(), first(), last(), seek(), at(), isActive(), isValid()
