    \property QGraphicsScene::focusOnTouch
    \since 5.12
    \brief whether items gain focus when receiving a \e {touch begin} event.

    The usual behavior is to transfer focus only when an item is clicked. Often
    a tap on a touchpad is interpreted as equivalent to a mouse click by the
    operating system, generating a synthesized click event in response. However,
    at least on macOS you can configure this behavior.

    By default, QGraphicsScene also transfers focus when you touch on a trackpad
    or similar. If the operating system is configured to not generate a
    synthetic mouse click on tapping the trackpad, this is surprising. If the
    operating system does generate synthetic mouse clicks on tapping the
    trackpad, the focus transfer on starting a touch gesture is unnecessary.

    With focusOnTouch switched off, QGraphicsScene behaves as one would expect
    on macOS.

    The default value is \c true, ensuring that the default behavior is just as
    in Qt versions prior to 5.12. Set to \c false to prevent touch events from
    triggering focus changes.
