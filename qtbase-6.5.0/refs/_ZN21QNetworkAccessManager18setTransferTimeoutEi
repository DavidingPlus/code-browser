    \since 5.15

    Sets \a timeout as the transfer timeout in milliseconds.

    Transfers are aborted if no bytes are transferred before
    the timeout expires. Zero means no timer is set. If no
    argument is provided, the timeout is
    QNetworkRequest::DefaultTransferTimeoutConstant. If this function
    is not called, the timeout is disabled and has the
    value zero. The request-specific non-zero timeouts set for
    the requests that are executed override this value. This means
    that if QNetworkAccessManager has an enabled timeout, it needs
    to be disabled to execute a request without a timeout.
