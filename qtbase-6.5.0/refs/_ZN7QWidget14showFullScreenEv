    Shows the widget in full-screen mode.

    Calling this function only affects \l{isWindow()}{windows}.

    To return from full-screen mode, call showNormal() or close().

    \note Full-screen mode works fine under Windows, but has certain
    problems under X. These problems are due to limitations of the
    ICCCM protocol that specifies the communication between X11
    clients and the window manager. ICCCM simply does not understand
    the concept of non-decorated full-screen windows. Therefore, the
    best we can do is to request a borderless window and place and
    resize it to fill the entire screen. Depending on the window
    manager, this may or may not work. The borderless window is
    requested using MOTIF hints, which are at least partially
    supported by virtually all modern window managers.

    An alternative would be to bypass the window manager entirely and
    create a window with the Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint flag. This
    has other severe problems though, like totally broken keyboard focus
    and very strange effects on desktop changes or when the user raises
    other windows.

    X11 window managers that follow modern post-ICCCM specifications
    support full-screen mode properly.

    On macOS, showing a window full screen puts the entire application in
    full-screen mode, providing it with a dedicated desktop. Showing another
    window while the application runs in full-screen mode might automatically
    make that window full screen as well. To prevent that, exit full-screen
    mode by calling showNormal() or by close() on the full screen window
    before showing another window.

    \sa showNormal(), showMaximized(), show(), isVisible(), close()
