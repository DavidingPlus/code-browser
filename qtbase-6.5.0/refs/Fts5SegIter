** Object for iterating through a single segment, visiting each term/rowid
** pair in the segment.
**
** pSeg:
**   The segment to iterate through.
**
** iLeafPgno:
**   Current leaf page number within segment.
**
** iLeafOffset:
**   Byte offset within the current leaf that is the first byte of the
**   position list data (one byte passed the position-list size field).
**   rowid field of the current entry. Usually this is the size field of the
**   position list data. The exception is if the rowid for the current entry
**   is the last thing on the leaf page.
**
** pLeaf:
**   Buffer containing current leaf page data. Set to NULL at EOF.
**
** iTermLeafPgno, iTermLeafOffset:
**   Leaf page number containing the last term read from the segment. And
**   the offset immediately following the term data.
**
** flags:
**   Mask of FTS5_SEGITER_XXX values. Interpreted as follows:
**
**   FTS5_SEGITER_ONETERM:
**     If set, set the iterator to point to EOF after the current doclist
**     has been exhausted. Do not proceed to the next term in the segment.
**
**   FTS5_SEGITER_REVERSE:
**     This flag is only ever set if FTS5_SEGITER_ONETERM is also set. If
**     it is set, iterate through rowid in descending order instead of the
**     default ascending order.
**
** iRowidOffset/nRowidOffset/aRowidOffset:
**     These are used if the FTS5_SEGITER_REVERSE flag is set.
**
**     For each rowid on the page corresponding to the current term, the
**     corresponding aRowidOffset[] entry is set to the byte offset of the
**     start of the &quot;position-list-size&quot; field within the page.
**
** iTermIdx:
**     Index of current term on iTermLeafPgno.
