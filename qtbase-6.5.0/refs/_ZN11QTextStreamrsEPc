    \overload

    Converts the word to UTF-8 and stores it in \a c, terminated by a &apos;\\0&apos;
    character. If no word is available, only the &apos;\\0&apos; character is stored.

    Warning: Although convenient, this operator is dangerous and must
    be used with care. QTextStream assumes that \a c points to a
    buffer with enough space to hold the word. If the buffer is too
    small, your application may crash. For a word consisting of \c{n} QChars,
    the buffer needs to be at least \c{3*n+1} characters long.

    If possible, use the QByteArray operator instead.
