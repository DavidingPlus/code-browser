    Create and write out initializers for tree widget items.
    This function makes sure that only needed items are fetched (subject to preprocessor
    conditionals), that each item is fetched from its parent widget/item exactly once
    and that no temporary variables are created for items that are needed only once. As
    fetches are built top-down from the root, but determining how often and under which
    conditions an item is needed needs to be done bottom-up, the whole process makes
    two passes, storing the intermediate result in a recursive StringInitializerListMap.
