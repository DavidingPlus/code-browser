// not be enough for various uses. Historically Firefox used 10K as the limit of
// a single field, but some Location headers and Authorization challenges can
// get even longer. Other browsers, such as Chrome, instead have a limit on the
// total size of all the headers (as well as extra limits on some of the
// individual fields). We&apos;ll use 100K as our default limit, which would be a ridiculously large
// header, with the possibility to override it where we need to.</doc>
