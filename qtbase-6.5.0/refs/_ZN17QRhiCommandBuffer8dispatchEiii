    Records dispatching compute work items, with \a x, \a y, and \a z
    specifying the number of local workgroups in the corresponding dimension.

    \note This function can only be called inside a compute pass, meaning
    between a beginComputePass() and endComputePass() call.

    \note \a x, \a y, and \a z must fit the limits from the underlying graphics
    API implementation at run time. The maximum values are typically 65535.

    \note Watch out for possible limits on the local workgroup size as well.
    This is specified in the shader, for example: \c{layout(local_size_x = 16,
    local_size_y = 16) in;}. For example, with OpenGL the minimum value mandated
    by the specification for the number of invocations in a single local work
    group (the product of \c local_size_x, \c local_size_y, and \c local_size_z)
    is 1024, while with OpenGL ES (3.1) the value may be as low as 128. This
    means that the example given above may be rejected by some OpenGL ES
    implementations as the number of invocations is 256.
