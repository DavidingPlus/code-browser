    \overload
    \deprecated
    Sends the \a message over this connection and returns immediately.
    When the reply is received, the method \a returnMethod is called in
    the \a receiver object.

    This function is suitable for method calls only. It is guaranteed
    that the slot will be called exactly once with the reply, as long
    as the parameter types match and no error occurs.

    This function is dangerous because it cannot report errors, including
    the expiration of the timeout.

    Returns \c true if the message was sent, or false if the message could
    not be sent.
