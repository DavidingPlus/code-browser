    \fn Qt::KeyboardModifiers QGuiApplication::queryKeyboardModifiers()

    Queries and returns the state of the modifier keys on the keyboard.
    Unlike keyboardModifiers, this method returns the actual keys held
    on the input device at the time of calling the method.

    It does not rely on the keypress events having been received by this
    process, which makes it possible to check the modifiers while moving
    a window, for instance. Note that in most cases, you should use
    keyboardModifiers(), which is faster and more accurate since it contains
    the state of the modifiers as they were when the currently processed
    event was received.

    \sa keyboardModifiers()
