 * Consumed modifiers mode.
 *
 * There are several possible methods for deciding which modifiers are
 * consumed and which are not, each applicable for different systems or
 * situations. The mode selects the method to use.
 *
 * Keep in mind that in all methods, the keymap may decide to &quot;preserve&quot;
 * a modifier, meaning it is not reported as consumed even if it would
 * have otherwise.
