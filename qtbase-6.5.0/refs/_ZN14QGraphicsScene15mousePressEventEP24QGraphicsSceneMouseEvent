    This event handler, for event \a mouseEvent, can be reimplemented
    in a subclass to receive mouse press events for the scene.

    The default implementation depends on the state of the scene. If
    there is a mouse grabber item, then the event is sent to the mouse
    grabber. Otherwise, it is forwarded to the topmost visible item that
    accepts mouse events at the scene position from the event, and
    that item promptly becomes the mouse grabber item.

    If there is no item at the given position on the scene, the
    selection area is reset, any focus item loses its input focus, and
    the event is then ignored.

    Note: See items() for a definition of which items are considered visible by this function.

    QGraphicsItem::setAcceptedMouseButtons()
