** Object for iterating through the merged results of one or more segments,
** visiting each term/rowid pair in the merged data.
**
** nSeg is always a power of two greater than or equal to the number of
** segments that this object is merging data from. Both the aSeg[] and
** aFirst[] arrays are sized at nSeg entries. The aSeg[] array is padded
** with zeroed objects - these are handled as if they were iterators opened
** on empty segments.
**
** The results of comparing segments aSeg[N] and aSeg[N+1], where N is an
** even number, is stored in aFirst[(nSeg+N)/2]. The &quot;result&quot; of the
** comparison in this context is the index of the iterator that currently
** points to the smaller term/rowid combination. Iterators at EOF are
** considered to be greater than all other iterators.
**
** aFirst[1] contains the index in aSeg[] of the iterator that points to
** the smallest key overall. aFirst[0] is unused.
**
** poslist:
**   Used by sqlite3Fts5IterPoslist() when the poslist needs to be buffered.
**   There is no way to tell if this is populated or not.
