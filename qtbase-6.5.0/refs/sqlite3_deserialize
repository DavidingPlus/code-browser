** CAPI3REF: Deserialize a database
**
** The sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) interface causes the
** [database connection] D to disconnect from database S and then
** reopen S as an in-memory database based on the serialization contained
** in P.  The serialized database P is N bytes in size.  M is the size of
** the buffer P, which might be larger than N.  If M is larger than N, and
** the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY bit is not set in F, then SQLite is
** permitted to add content to the in-memory database as long as the total
** size does not exceed M bytes.
**
** If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in F, then SQLite will
** invoke sqlite3_free() on the serialization buffer when the database
** connection closes.  If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE bit is set, then
** SQLite will try to increase the buffer size using sqlite3_realloc64()
** if writes on the database cause it to grow larger than M bytes.
**
** The sqlite3_deserialize() interface will fail with SQLITE_BUSY if the
** database is currently in a read transaction or is involved in a backup
** operation.
**
** It is not possible to deserialized into the TEMP database.  If the
** S argument to sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) is &quot;temp&quot; then the
** function returns SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** If sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) fails for any reason and if the
** SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in argument F, then
** [sqlite3_free()] is invoked on argument P prior to returning.
**
** This interface is omitted if SQLite is compiled with the
** [SQLITE_OMIT_DESERIALIZE] option.
