** Each SQL function is defined by an instance of the following
** structure.  For global built-in functions (ex: substr(), max(), count())
** a pointer to this structure is held in the sqlite3BuiltinFunctions object.
** For per-connection application-defined functions, a pointer to this
** structure is held in the db-&gt;aHash hash table.

** The u.pHash field is used by the global built-ins.  The u.pDestructor
** field is used by per-connection app-def functions.
