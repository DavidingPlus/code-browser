 * Clear a variable or struct member that contains a #DBusPendingCall.
 * If it does not contain #NULL, the pending call that was previously
 * there is unreferenced with dbus_pending_call_unref().
 *
 * This is very similar to dbus_clear_connection(): see that function
 * for more details.
 *
 * @param pointer_to_pending_call A pointer to a variable or struct member.
 * pointer_to_pending_call must not be #NULL, but *pointer_to_pending_call
 * may be #NULL.
