<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='4338'>\value CompileShadersWithDebugInfo Requests compiling shaders with debug
    information enabled. This is relevant only when runtime shader compilation
    from source code is involved, and only when the underlying infrastructure
    supports this. With concrete examples, this is not relevant with Vulkan and
    SPIR-V, because the GLSL-to-SPIR-V compilation does not happen at run
    time. On the other hand, consider Direct3D and HLSL, where there are
    multiple options: when the QShader packages ship with pre-compiled bytecode
    (\c DXBC), debug information is to be requested through the tool that
    generates the \c{.qsb} file, similarly to the case of Vulkan and
    SPIR-V. However, when having HLSL source code in the pre- or
    runtime-generated QShader packages, the first phase of compilation (HLSL
    source to intermediate format) happens at run time too, with this flag taken
    into account. Debug information is relevant in particular with tools like
    RenderDoc since it allows seeing the original source code when investigating
    the pipeline and when performing vertex or fragment shader debugging.</doc>
