** This object is used in various ways, most (but not all) related to window
** functions.
**
**   (1) A single instance of this structure is attached to the
**       the Expr.y.pWin field for each window function in an expression tree.
**       This object holds the information contained in the OVER clause,
**       plus additional fields used during code generation.
**
**   (2) All window functions in a single SELECT form a linked-list
**       attached to Select.pWin.  The Window.pFunc and Window.pExpr
**       fields point back to the expression that is the window function.
**
**   (3) The terms of the WINDOW clause of a SELECT are instances of this
**       object on a linked list attached to Select.pWinDefn.
**
**   (4) For an aggregate function with a FILTER clause, an instance
**       of this object is stored in Expr.y.pWin with eFrmType set to
**       TK_FILTER. In this case the only field used is Window.pFilter.
**
** The uses (1) and (2) are really the same Window object that just happens
** to be accessible in two different ways.  Use case (3) are separate objects.
