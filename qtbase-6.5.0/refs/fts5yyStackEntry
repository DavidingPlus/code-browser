**   +  The value of the token stored at this level of the stack.
**      (In other words, the &quot;major&quot; token.)

**   +  The semantic value stored at this level of the stack.  This is

**      It is sometimes called the &quot;minor&quot; token.

** After the &quot;shift&quot; half of a SHIFTREDUCE action, the stateno field
