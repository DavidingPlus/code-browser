    Attempts to release resources in the backend&apos;s caches. This can include both
    CPU and GPU resources.  Only memory and resources that can be recreated
    automatically are in scope. As an example, if the backend&apos;s
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline implementation maintains a cache of shader compilation
    results, calling this function leads to emptying that cache, thus
    potentially freeing up memory and graphics resources.

    Calling this function makes sense in resource constrained environments,
    where at a certain point there is a need to ensure minimal resource usage,
    at the expense of performance.
