    \fn float QVector3D::distanceToLine(QVector3D point, QVector3D direction) const

    Returns the distance that this vertex is from a line defined
    by \a point and the unit vector \a direction.

    If \a direction is a null vector, then it does not define a line.
    In that case, the distance from \a point to this vertex is returned.
