    \since 4.4
    Sets the bounding region granularity to \a granularity; a value between
    and including 0 and 1. The default value is 0 (i.e., the lowest
    granularity, where the bounding region corresponds to the item&apos;s bounding
    rectangle).

    The granularity is used by boundingRegion() to calculate how fine the
    bounding region of the item should be. The highest achievable granularity
    is 1, where boundingRegion() will return the finest outline possible for
    the respective device (e.g., for a QGraphicsView viewport, this gives you
    a pixel-perfect bounding region). The lowest possible granularity is
    0. The value of \a granularity describes the ratio between device
    resolution and the resolution of the bounding region (e.g., a value of
    0.25 will provide a region where each chunk corresponds to 4x4 device
    units / pixels).
