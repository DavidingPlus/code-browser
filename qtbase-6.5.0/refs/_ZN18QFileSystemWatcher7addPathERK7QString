    Adds \a path to the file system watcher if \a path exists. The
    path is not added if it does not exist, or if it is already being
    monitored by the file system watcher.

    If \a path specifies a directory, the directoryChanged() signal
    will be emitted when \a path is modified or removed from disk;
    otherwise the fileChanged() signal is emitted when \a path is
    modified, renamed or removed.

    If the watch was successful, true is returned.

    Reasons for a watch failure are generally system-dependent, but
    may include the resource not existing, access failures, or the
    total watch count limit, if the platform has one.

    \note There may be a system dependent limit to the number of
    files and directories that can be monitored simultaneously.
    If this limit is been reached, \a path will not be monitored,
    and false is returned.
