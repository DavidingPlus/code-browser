 * GPollFD:
 * @fd: the file descriptor to poll (or a HANDLE on Win32)
 * @events: a bitwise combination from #GIOCondition, specifying which
 *     events should be polled for. Typically for reading from a file
 *     descriptor you would use %G_IO_IN | %G_IO_HUP | %G_IO_ERR, and
 *     for writing you would use %G_IO_OUT | %G_IO_ERR.
 * @revents: a bitwise combination of flags from #GIOCondition, returned
 *     from the poll() function to indicate which events occurred.
 *
 * Represents a file descriptor, which events to poll for, and which events
 * occurred.
