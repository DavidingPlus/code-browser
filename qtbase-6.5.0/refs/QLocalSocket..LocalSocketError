    \enum QLocalSocket::LocalSocketError

    The LocalServerError enumeration represents the errors that can occur.
    The most recent error can be retrieved through a call to
    \l QLocalSocket::error().

    \value ConnectionRefusedError The connection was refused by
        the peer (or timed out).
    \value PeerClosedError  The remote socket closed the connection.
        Note that the client socket (i.e., this socket) will be closed
        after the remote close notification has been sent.
    \value ServerNotFoundError  The local socket name was not found.
    \value SocketAccessError The socket operation failed because the
        application lacked the required privileges.
    \value SocketResourceError The local system ran out of resources
        (e.g., too many sockets).
    \value SocketTimeoutError The socket operation timed out.
    \value DatagramTooLargeError The datagram was larger than the operating
        system&apos;s limit (which can be as low as 8192 bytes).
    \value ConnectionError An error occurred with the connection.
    \value UnsupportedSocketOperationError The requested socket operation
        is not supported by the local operating system.
    \value OperationError An operation was attempted while the socket was in a state that
           did not permit it.
    \value UnknownSocketError An unidentified error occurred.
