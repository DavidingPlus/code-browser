\fn void QAbstractButton::toggled(bool checked)

This signal is emitted whenever a checkable button changes its state.
\a checked is true if the button is checked, or false if the button is
unchecked.

This may be the result of a user action, click() slot activation,
or because setChecked() is called.

The states of buttons in exclusive button groups are updated before this
signal is emitted. This means that slots can act on either the &quot;off&quot;
signal or the &quot;on&quot; signal emitted by the buttons in the group whose
states have changed.

For example, a slot that reacts to signals emitted by newly checked
buttons but which ignores signals from buttons that have been unchecked
can be implemented using the following pattern:

\snippet code/src_gui_widgets_qabstractbutton.cpp 2

Button groups can be created using the QButtonGroup class, and
updates to the button states monitored with the
\l{QButtonGroup::buttonClicked()} signal.

\sa checked, clicked()
