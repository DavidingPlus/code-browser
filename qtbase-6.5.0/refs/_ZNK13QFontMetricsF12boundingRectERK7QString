    Returns the bounding rectangle of the characters in the string
    specified by \a text. The bounding rectangle always covers at least
    the set of pixels the text would cover if drawn at (0, 0).

    Note that the bounding rectangle may extend to the left of (0, 0),
    e.g. for italicized fonts, and that the width of the returned
    rectangle might be different than what the horizontalAdvance() method returns.

    If you want to know the advance width of the string (to lay out
    a set of strings next to each other), use horizontalAdvance() instead.

    Newline characters are processed as normal characters, \e not as
    linebreaks.

    The height of the bounding rectangle is at least as large as the
    value returned height().
