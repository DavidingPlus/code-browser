    Removes all the actions from the menu bar.

    \note On \macos, menu items that have been merged to the system
    menu bar are not removed by this function. One way to handle this
    would be to remove the extra actions yourself. You can set the
    \l{QAction::MenuRole}{menu role} on the different menus, so that
    you know ahead of time which menu items get merged and which do
    not. Then decide what to recreate or remove yourself.
