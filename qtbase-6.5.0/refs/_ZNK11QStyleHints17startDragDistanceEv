    \property QStyleHints::startDragDistance
    \brief the distance, in pixels, that the mouse must be moved with a button
    held down before a drag and drop operation will begin.

    If you support drag and drop in your application, and want to start a drag
    and drop operation after the user has moved the cursor a certain distance
    with a button held down, you should use this property&apos;s value as the
    minimum distance required.

    For example, if the mouse position of the click is stored in \c startPos
    and the current position (e.g. in the mouse move event) is \c currentPos,
    you can find out if a drag should be started with code like this:

    \snippet code/src_gui_kernel_qapplication.cpp 6

    \sa startDragTime, QPoint::manhattanLength(), {Drag and Drop}
