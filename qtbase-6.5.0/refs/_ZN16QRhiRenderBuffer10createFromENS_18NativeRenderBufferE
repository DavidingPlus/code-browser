    Similar to create() except that no new native renderbuffer objects are
    created. Instead, the native renderbuffer object specified by \a src is
    used.

    This allows importing an existing renderbuffer object (which must belong to
    the same device or sharing context, depending on the graphics API) from an
    external graphics engine.

    \note This is currently applicable to OpenGL only. This function exists
    solely to allow importing a renderbuffer object that is bound to some
    special, external object, such as an EGLImageKHR. Once the application
    performed the glEGLImageTargetRenderbufferStorageOES call, the renderbuffer
    object can be passed to this function to create a wrapping
    QRhiRenderBuffer, which in turn can be passed in as a color attachment to
    a QRhiTextureRenderTarget to enable rendering to the EGLImage.

    \note pixelSize(), sampleCount(), and flags() must still be set correctly.
    Passing incorrect sizes and other values to QRhi::newRenderBuffer() and
    then following it with a createFrom() expecting that the native
    renderbuffer object alone is sufficient to deduce such values is \b wrong
    and will lead to problems.

    \note QRhiRenderBuffer does not take ownership of the native object, and
    destroy() will not release that object.

    \note This function is only implemented when the QRhi::RenderBufferImport
    feature is reported as \l{QRhi::isFeatureSupported()}{supported}. Otherwise,
    the function does nothing and the return value is \c false.

    \return \c true when successful, \c false when not supported.
