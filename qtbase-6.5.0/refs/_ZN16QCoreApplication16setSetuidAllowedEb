    \since 5.3

    Allows the application to run setuid on UNIX platforms if \a allow
    is true.

    If \a allow is false (the default) and Qt detects the application is
    running with an effective user id different than the real user id,
    the application will be aborted when a QCoreApplication instance is
    created.

    Qt is not an appropriate solution for setuid programs due to its
    large attack surface. However some applications may be required
    to run in this manner for historical reasons. This flag will
    prevent Qt from aborting the application when this is detected,
    and must be set before a QCoreApplication instance is created.

    \note It is strongly recommended not to enable this option since
    it introduces security risks.
