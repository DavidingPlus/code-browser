    Sets the floating point precision of the data stream to \a precision. If the floating point precision is
    DoublePrecision and the version of the data stream is Qt_4_6 or higher, all floating point
    numbers will be written and read with 64-bit precision. If the floating point precision is
    SinglePrecision and the version is Qt_4_6 or higher, all floating point numbers will be written
    and read with 32-bit precision.

    For versions prior to Qt_4_6, the precision of floating point numbers in the data stream depends
    on the stream operator called.

    The default is DoublePrecision.

    Note that this property does not affect the serialization or deserialization of \c qfloat16
    instances.

    \warning This property must be set to the same value on the object that writes and the object
    that reads the data stream.
