        Can be called if the mutexes have been unlocked manually, and sets the
        state of the QOrderedMutexLocker to unlocked.
        The caller is expected to have unlocked both of them if they
        are not the same. Calling this method when the QOrderedMutexLocker is
        unlocked or when the provided mutexes have not actually been unlocked is
        UB.
