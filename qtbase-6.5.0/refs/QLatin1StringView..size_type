    \typedef QLatin1StringView::size_type
    \since 5.10

    Alias for \c{qsizetype}. Provided for compatibility with the STL.

    \note In version prior to Qt 6, this was an alias for \c{int},
    restricting the amount of data that could be held in a QLatin1StringView
    on 64-bit architectures.
