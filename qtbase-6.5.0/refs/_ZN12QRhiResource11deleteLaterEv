    When called without a frame being recorded, this function is equivalent to
    deleting the object. Between a QRhi::beginFrame() and QRhi::endFrame()
    however the behavior is different: the QRhiResource will not be destroyed
    until the frame is submitted via QRhi::endFrame(), thus satisfying the QRhi
    requirement of not altering QRhiResource objects that are referenced by the
    frame being recorded.
