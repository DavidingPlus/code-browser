    Adds a segment of a TCB bezier spline to define a custom easing curve.
    It is only applicable if type() is QEasingCurve::TCBSpline.
    The spline has to start explicitly at (0.0, 0.0) and has to end at (1.0, 1.0) to
    be a valid easing curve.
    The tension \a t changes the length of the tangent vector.
    The continuity \a c changes the sharpness in change between the tangents.
    The bias \a b changes the direction of the tangent vector.
    \a nextPoint is the sample position.
    All three parameters are valid between -1 and 1 and define the
    tangent of the control point.
    If all three parameters are 0 the resulting spline is a Catmull-Rom spline.
    The begin and endpoint always have a bias of -1 and 1, since the outer tangent is not defined.
