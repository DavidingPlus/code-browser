     * This is the mode defined in the XKB specification and used by libX11.
     *
     * A modifier is consumed if and only if it *may affect* key translation.
     *
     * For example, if `Control+Alt+&lt;Backspace&gt;` produces some assigned keysym,
     * then when pressing just `&lt;Backspace&gt;`, `Control` and `Alt` are consumed,
     * even though they are not active, since if they *were* active they would
     * have affected key translation.
