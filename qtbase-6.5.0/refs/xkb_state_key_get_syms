 * Get the keysyms obtained from pressing a particular key in a given
 * keyboard state.
 *
 * Get the keysyms for a key according to the current active layout,
 * modifiers and shift level for the key, as determined by a keyboard
 * state.
 *
 * @param[in]  state    The keyboard state object.
 * @param[in]  key      The keycode of the key.
 * @param[out] syms_out An immutable array of keysyms corresponding the
 * key in the given keyboard state.
 *
 * As an extension to XKB, this function can return more than one keysym.
 * If you do not want to handle this case, you can use
 * xkb_state_key_get_one_sym() for a simpler interface.
 *
 * This function does not perform any @ref keysym-transformations.
 * (This might change).
 *
 * @returns The number of keysyms in the syms_out array.  If no keysyms
 * are produced by the key in the given keyboard state, returns 0 and sets
 * syms_out to NULL.
