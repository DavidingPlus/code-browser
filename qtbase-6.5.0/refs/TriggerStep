** An instance of struct TriggerStep is used to store a single SQL statement
** that is a part of a trigger-program.
**
** Instances of struct TriggerStep are stored in a singly linked list (linked
** using the &quot;pNext&quot; member) referenced by the &quot;step_list&quot; member of the
** associated struct Trigger instance. The first element of the linked list is
** the first step of the trigger-program.
**
** The &quot;op&quot; member indicates whether this is a &quot;DELETE&quot;, &quot;INSERT&quot;, &quot;UPDATE&quot; or
** &quot;SELECT&quot; statement. The meanings of the other members is determined by the
** value of &quot;op&quot; as follows:
**
** (op == TK_INSERT)
** orconf    -&gt; stores the ON CONFLICT algorithm
** pSelect   -&gt; The content to be inserted - either a SELECT statement or
**              a VALUES clause.
** zTarget   -&gt; Dequoted name of the table to insert into.
** pIdList   -&gt; If this is an INSERT INTO ... (&lt;column-names&gt;) VALUES ...
**              statement, then this stores the column-names to be
**              inserted into.
** pUpsert   -&gt; The ON CONFLICT clauses for an Upsert
**
** (op == TK_DELETE)
** zTarget   -&gt; Dequoted name of the table to delete from.
** pWhere    -&gt; The WHERE clause of the DELETE statement if one is specified.
**              Otherwise NULL.
**
** (op == TK_UPDATE)
** zTarget   -&gt; Dequoted name of the table to update.
** pWhere    -&gt; The WHERE clause of the UPDATE statement if one is specified.
**              Otherwise NULL.
** pExprList -&gt; A list of the columns to update and the expressions to update
**              them to. See sqlite3Update() documentation of &quot;pChanges&quot;
**              argument.
**
** (op == TK_SELECT)
** pSelect   -&gt; The SELECT statement
**
** (op == TK_RETURNING)
** pExprList -&gt; The list of expressions that follow the RETURNING keyword.
