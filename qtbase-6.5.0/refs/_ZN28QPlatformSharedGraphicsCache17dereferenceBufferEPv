    \fn bool QPlatformSharedGraphicsCache::dereferenceBuffer(void *bufferId)

    Removed a previously registered reference to the buffer \a bufferId. Returns \c true if there
    are still more references to the buffer in question, or false if this was the last reference
    (in which case the buffer may have been deleted in the cache.)
