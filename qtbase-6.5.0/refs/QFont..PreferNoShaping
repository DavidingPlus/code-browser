<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/text/qfont.cpp' l='1446'>\value PreferNoShaping Sometimes, a font will apply complex rules to a set of characters in
           order to display them correctly. In some writing systems, such as Brahmic scripts, this is
           required in order for the text to be legible, but in e.g. Latin script, it is merely
           a cosmetic feature. The PreferNoShaping flag will disable all such features when they
           are not required, which will improve performance in most cases (since Qt 5.10).</doc>
