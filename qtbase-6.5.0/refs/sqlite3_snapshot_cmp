** CAPI3REF: Compare the ages of two snapshot handles.
** METHOD: sqlite3_snapshot
**
** The sqlite3_snapshot_cmp(P1, P2) interface is used to compare the ages
** of two valid snapshot handles.
**
** If the two snapshot handles are not associated with the same database
** file, the result of the comparison is undefined.
**
** Additionally, the result of the comparison is only valid if both of the
** snapshot handles were obtained by calling sqlite3_snapshot_get() since the
** last time the wal file was deleted. The wal file is deleted when the
** database is changed back to rollback mode or when the number of database
** clients drops to zero. If either snapshot handle was obtained before the
** wal file was last deleted, the value returned by this function
** is undefined.
**
** Otherwise, this API returns a negative value if P1 refers to an older
** snapshot than P2, zero if the two handles refer to the same database
** snapshot, and a positive value if P1 is a newer snapshot than P2.
**
** This interface is only available if SQLite is compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_SNAPSHOT] option.
