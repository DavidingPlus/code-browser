<doc f='include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h' l='436'>/**
 * Get a keysym from its name.
 *
 * @param name The name of a keysym. See remarks in xkb_keysym_get_name();
 * this function will accept any name returned by that function.
 * @param flags A set of flags controlling how the search is done. If
 * invalid flags are passed, this will fail with XKB_KEY_NoSymbol.
 *
 * If you use the XKB_KEYSYM_CASE_INSENSITIVE flag and two keysym names
 * differ only by case, then the lower-case keysym is returned.  For
 * instance, for KEY_a and KEY_A, this function would return KEY_a for the
 * case-insensitive search.  If this functionality is needed, it is
 * recommended to first call this function without this flag; and if that
 * fails, only then to try with this flag, while possibly warning the user
 * he had misspelled the name, and might get wrong results.
 *
 * Case folding is done according to the C locale; the current locale is not
 * consulted.
 *
 * @returns The keysym. If the name is invalid, returns XKB_KEY_NoSymbol.
