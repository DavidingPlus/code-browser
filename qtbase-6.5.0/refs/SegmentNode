** Type SegmentNode is used by the following three functions to create
** the interior part of the segment b+-tree structures (everything except
** the leaf nodes). These functions and type are only ever used by code
** within the fts3SegWriterXXX() family of functions described above.
**
**   fts3NodeAddTerm()
**   fts3NodeWrite()
**   fts3NodeFree()
**
** When a b+tree is written to the database (either as a result of a merge
** or the pending-terms table being flushed), leaves are written into the
** database file as soon as they are completely populated. The interior of
** the tree is assembled in memory and written out only once all leaves have
** been populated and stored. This is Ok, as the b+-tree fanout is usually
** very large, meaning that the interior of the tree consumes relatively
** little memory.
