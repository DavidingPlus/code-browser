   This function returns the selected version of the path, based on the conditions at runtime.
   If no selectable files are present, returns the original \a filePath.

   If the original file does not exist, the original \a filePath is returned. This means that you
   must have a base file to fall back on, you cannot have only files in selectable sub-directories.

   See the class overview for the selection algorithm.
