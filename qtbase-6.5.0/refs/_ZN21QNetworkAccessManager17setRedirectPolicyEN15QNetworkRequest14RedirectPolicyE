    Sets the manager&apos;s redirect policy to be the \a policy specified. This policy
    will affect all subsequent requests created by the manager.

    Use this function to enable or disable HTTP redirects on the manager&apos;s level.

    \note When creating a request QNetworkRequest::RedirectAttributePolicy has
    the highest priority, next by priority the manager&apos;s policy.

    The default value is QNetworkRequest::NoLessSafeRedirectPolicy.
    Clients relying on manual redirect handling are encouraged to set
    this policy explicitly in their code.
