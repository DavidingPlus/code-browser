    This is a convenience static function that will return the content of a file
    selected by the user.

    This function is used to access local files on Qt for WebAssembly, where the web
    sandbox places restrictions on how such access may happen. Its implementation will
    make the browser display a native file dialog, where the user makes the file selection
    based on the parameter \a nameFilter.

    It can also be used on other platforms, where it will fall back to using QFileDialog.

    The function is asynchronous and returns immediately. The \a fileOpenCompleted
    callback will be called when a file has been selected and its contents have been
    read into memory.
