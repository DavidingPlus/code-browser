    Returns a list of QPrinterInfo objects for all the available printers
    on this system.

    It is NOT recommended to use this as creating each printer instance may
    take a long time, especially if there are remote networked printers, and
    retained instances may become outdated if changes are made on the local
    system or remote print server. Use availablePrinterNames() instead and
    only instantiate printer instances as you need them.
