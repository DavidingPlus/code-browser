    \fn bool QCborValue::isUndefined() const

    Returns true if this QCborValue is of the undefined type.

    CBOR undefined values are used to indicate missing information, usually as
    a result of a previous operation that did not complete as expected. They
    are also used by the QCborArray and QCborMap API to indicate the searched
    item was not found.

    Undefined values are distinct from null values.

    QCborValue objects with undefined values are also different from invalid
    QCborValue objects. The API will not create invalid QCborValues, but they
    may exist as a result of a parsing error.
