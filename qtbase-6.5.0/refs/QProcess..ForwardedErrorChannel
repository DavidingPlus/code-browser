<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/corelib/io/qprocess.cpp' l='670'>\value ForwardedErrorChannel QProcess manages the standard output
    of the running process, but forwards its standard error onto the
    main process. This reflects the typical use of command line tools
    as filters, where the standard output is redirected to another
    process or a file, while standard error is printed to the console
    for diagnostic purposes.
