 * Get the result Unicode/UTF-8 string for a composed sequence.
 *
 * See @ref compose-overview for more details.  This function is only
 * useful when the status is XKB_COMPOSE_COMPOSED.
 *
 * @param[in] state
 *     The compose state.
 * @param[out] buffer
 *     A buffer to write the string into.
 * @param[in] size
 *     Size of the buffer.
 *
 * @warning If the buffer passed is too small, the string is truncated
 * (though still NUL-terminated).
 *
 * @returns
 *   The number of bytes required for the string, excluding the NUL byte.
 *   If the sequence is not complete, or does not have a viable result
 *   string, returns 0, and sets `buffer` to the empty string (if possible).
 * @returns
 *   You may check if truncation has occurred by comparing the return value
 *   with the size of `buffer`, similarly to the `snprintf`(3) function.
 *   You may safely pass NULL and 0 to `buffer` and `size` to find the
 *   required size (without the NUL-byte).
