    \fn bool QRhiTextureRenderTarget::create()

    Creates the corresponding native graphics resources. If there are already
    resources present due to an earlier create() with no corresponding
    destroy(), then destroy() is called implicitly first.

    \note renderPassDescriptor() must be set before calling create(). To obtain
    a QRhiRenderPassDescriptor compatible with the render target, call
    newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor() before create() but after setting all
    other parameters, such as description() and flags(). To save resources,
    reuse the same QRhiRenderPassDescriptor with multiple
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget instances, whenever possible. Sharing the same
    render pass descriptor is only possible when the render targets have the
    same number and type of attachments (the actual textures can differ) and
    the same flags.

    \note resources, such as QRhiTexture instances, referenced in description()
    must already have create() called on them.

    \return \c true when successful, \c false when a graphics operation failed.
    Regardless of the return value, calling destroy() is always safe.
