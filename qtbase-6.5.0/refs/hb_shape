 * hb_shape:
 * @font: an #hb_font_t to use for shaping
 * @buffer: an #hb_buffer_t to shape
 * @features: (array length=num_features) (nullable): an array of user
 *    specified #hb_feature_t or `NULL`
 * @num_features: the length of @features array
 *
 * Shapes @buffer using @font turning its Unicode characters content to
 * positioned glyphs. If @features is not `NULL`, it will be used to control the
 * features applied during shaping. If two @features have the same tag but
 * overlapping ranges the value of the feature with the higher index takes
 * precedence.
