 * Indic configurations.  Note that we do not want to keep every single script-specific
 * behavior in these tables necessarily.  This should mainly be used for per-script
 * properties that are cheaper keeping here, than in the code.  Ie. if, say, one and
 * only one script has an exception, that one script can be if&apos;ed directly in the code,
 * instead of adding a new flag in these structs.
