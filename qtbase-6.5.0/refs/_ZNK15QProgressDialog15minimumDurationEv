    \property QProgressDialog::minimumDuration
    \brief the time that must pass before the dialog appears

    If the expected duration of the task is less than the
    minimumDuration, the dialog will not appear at all. This prevents
    the dialog popping up for tasks that are quickly over. For tasks
    that are expected to exceed the minimumDuration, the dialog will
    pop up after the minimumDuration time or as soon as any progress
    is set.

    If set to 0, the dialog is always shown as soon as any progress is
    set. The default is 4000 milliseconds.
