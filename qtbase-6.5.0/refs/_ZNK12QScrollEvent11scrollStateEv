    \fn QScrollEvent::ScrollState QScrollEvent::scrollState() const

    Returns the current scroll state as a combination of ScrollStateFlag values.
    ScrollStarted (or ScrollFinished) will be set, if this scroll event is the first (or last) event in a scrolling activity.
    Please note that both values can be set at the same time, if the activity consists of a single QScrollEvent.
    All other scroll events in between will have their state set to ScrollUpdated.

    A widget could for example revert selections when scrolling is started and stopped.
