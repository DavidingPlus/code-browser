    \property QPlainTextEdit::maximumBlockCount
    \brief the limit for blocks in the document.

    Specifies the maximum number of blocks the document may have. If there are
    more blocks in the document that specified with this property blocks are removed
    from the beginning of the document.

    A negative or zero value specifies that the document may contain an unlimited
    amount of blocks.

    The default value is 0.

    Note that setting this property will apply the limit immediately to the document
    contents. Setting this property also disables the undo redo history.
