 * \fn const uint8_t *cbor_value_get_next_byte(const CborValue *it)
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the next byte that would be decoded if this CborValue
 * object were advanced.
 *
 * This function is useful if cbor_value_at_end() returns true for the
 * outermost CborValue: the pointer returned is the first byte of the data
 * remaining in the buffer, if any. Code can decide whether to begin decoding a
 * new CBOR data stream from this point, or parse some other data appended to
 * the same buffer.
 *
 * This function may be used even after a parsing error. If that occurred,
 * then this function returns a pointer to where the parsing error occurred.
 * Note that the error recovery is not precise and the pointer may not indicate
 * the exact byte containing bad data.
 *
 * This function makes sense only when using a linear buffer (that is, when the
 * parser is initialize by cbor_parser_init()). If using an external source,
 * this function may return garbage; instead, consult the external source itself
 * to find out more details about the presence of more data.
