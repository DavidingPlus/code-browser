    Like beginEditBlock() indicates the start of a block of editing operations
    that should appear as a single operation for undo/redo. However unlike
    beginEditBlock() it does not start a new block but reverses the previous call to
    endEditBlock() and therefore makes following operations part of the previous edit block created.

    For example:

    \snippet code/src_gui_text_qtextcursor.cpp 3

    The call to undo() will cause all three insertions to be undone.

    \sa beginEditBlock(), endEditBlock()
