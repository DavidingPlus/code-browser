    \return the HDR information for the associated display.

    The returned struct is always the default one if createOrResize() has not
    been successfully called yet.

    \note What happens when moving a window with an initialized swapchain
    between displays (HDR to HDR with different characteristics, HDR to SDR,
    etc.) is not currently well-defined and depends heavily on the windowing
    system and compositor, with potentially varying behavior between platforms.
    Currently QRhi only guarantees that hdrInfo() returns valid data, if
    available, for the display to which the swapchain&apos;s associated window
    belonged at the time of createOrResize().
