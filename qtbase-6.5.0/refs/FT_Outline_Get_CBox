   *
   * @function:
   *   FT_Outline_Get_CBox
   *
   * @description:
   *   Return an outline&apos;s &apos;control box&apos;.  The control box encloses all the
   *   outline&apos;s points, including Bezier control points.  Though it
   *   coincides with the exact bounding box for most glyphs, it can be
   *   slightly larger in some situations (like when rotating an outline that
   *   contains Bezier outside arcs).
   *
   *   Computing the control box is very fast, while getting the bounding box
   *   can take much more time as it needs to walk over all segments and arcs
   *   in the outline.  To get the latter, you can use the &apos;ftbbox&apos;
   *   component, which is dedicated to this single task.
   *
   * @input:
   *   outline ::
   *     A pointer to the source outline descriptor.
   *
   * @output:
   *   acbox ::
   *     The outline&apos;s control box.
   *
   * @note:
   *   See @FT_Glyph_Get_CBox for a discussion of tricky fonts.
