  Returns a pointer to a string that is the string \a ba represented
  as a space-separated sequence of hex characters. If the input is
  considered too long, it is truncated. A trucation is indicated in
  the returned string as an ellipsis at the end. The caller has
  ownership of the returned pointer and must ensure it is later passed
  to operator delete[].

  \a length is the length of the string \a ba.
