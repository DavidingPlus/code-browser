<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='626'>\value ReadBackAnyTextureFormat Indicates that reading back texture
    contents can be expected to work for any QRhiTexture::Format. Backends
    other than OpenGL can be expected to return true for this feature. When
    reported as false, which will typically happen with OpenGL, only the
    formats QRhiTexture::RGBA8 and QRhiTexture::BGRA8 are guaranteed to be
    supported for readbacks. In addition, with OpenGL, but not OpenGL ES,
    reading back the 1 byte per component formats QRhiTexture::R8 and
    QRhiTexture::RED_OR_ALPHA8 are supported as well. Reading back floating
    point formats QRhiTexture::RGBA16F and RGBA32F may work too with OpenGL, as
    long as the implementation provides support for these, but QRhi can give no
    guarantees, as indicated by this flag.</doc>
