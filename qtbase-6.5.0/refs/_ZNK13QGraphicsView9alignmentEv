    \property QGraphicsView::alignment
    \brief the alignment of the scene in the view when the whole
    scene is visible.

    If the whole scene is visible in the view, (i.e., there are no visible
    scroll bars,) the view&apos;s alignment will decide where the scene will be
    rendered in the view. For example, if the alignment is Qt::AlignCenter,
    which is default, the scene will be centered in the view, and if the
    alignment is (Qt::AlignLeft | Qt::AlignTop), the scene will be rendered in
    the top-left corner of the view.
