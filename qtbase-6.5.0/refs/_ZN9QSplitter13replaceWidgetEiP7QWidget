    \since 5.9

    Replaces the widget in the splitter&apos;s layout at the given \a index by \a widget.

    Returns the widget that has just been replaced if \a index is valid and \a widget
    is not already a child of the splitter. Otherwise, it returns null and no replacement
    or addition is made.

    The geometry of the newly inserted widget will be the same as the widget it replaces.
    Its visible and collapsed states are also inherited.

    \note The splitter takes ownership of \a widget and sets the parent of the
    replaced widget to null.

    \note Because \a widget gets \l{QWidget::setParent()}{reparented} into the splitter,
    its \l{QWidget::}{geometry} may not be set right away, but only after \a widget will
    receive the appropriate events.
