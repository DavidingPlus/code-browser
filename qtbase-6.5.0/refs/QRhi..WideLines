<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='559'>\value WideLines Indicates that lines with a width other than 1 are
    supported. When reported as not supported, the line width set on the
    graphics pipeline state is ignored. This can always be false with some
    backends (D3D11, Metal). With Vulkan, the value depends on the
    implementation. With OpenGL, wide lines are not supported in core profile
    contexts.</doc>
