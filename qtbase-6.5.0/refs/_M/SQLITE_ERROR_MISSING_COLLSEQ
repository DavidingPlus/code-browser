** CAPI3REF: Extended Result Codes
** KEYWORDS: {extended result code definitions}
**
** In its default configuration, SQLite API routines return one of 30 integer
** [result codes].  However, experience has shown that many of
** these result codes are too coarse-grained.  They do not provide as
** much information about problems as programmers might like.  In an effort to
** address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 [dateof:3.3.8]
** and later) include
** support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information
** about errors. These [extended result codes] are enabled or disabled
** on a per database connection basis using the
** [sqlite3_extended_result_codes()] API.  Or, the extended code for
** the most recent error can be obtained using
** [sqlite3_extended_errcode()].
