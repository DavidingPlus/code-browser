 * g_try_new0:
 * @struct_type: the type of the elements to allocate
 * @n_structs: the number of elements to allocate
 * 
 * Attempts to allocate @n_structs elements of type @struct_type, initialized
 * to 0&apos;s, and returns %NULL on failure. Contrast with g_new0(), which aborts
 * the program on failure.
 * The returned pointer is cast to a pointer to the given type.
 * The function returns %NULL when @n_structs is 0 or if an overflow occurs.
 * 
 * Since: 2.8
 * Returns: a pointer to the allocated memory, cast to a pointer to @struct_type
