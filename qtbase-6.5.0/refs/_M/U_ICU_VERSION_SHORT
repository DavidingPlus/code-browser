 * The current ICU library major version number as a string, for library name suffixes.
 * This value will change in subsequent releases of ICU.
 *
 * Until ICU 4.8, this was the combination of the single-digit major and minor ICU version numbers
 * into one string without dots (&quot;48&quot;).
 * Since ICU 49, it is the double-digit major ICU version number.
 * See http://userguide.icu-project.org/design#TOC-Version-Numbers-in-ICU
