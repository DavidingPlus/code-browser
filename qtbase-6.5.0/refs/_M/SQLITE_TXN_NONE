** CAPI3REF: Allowed return values from [sqlite3_txn_state()]
** KEYWORDS: {transaction state}
**
** These constants define the current transaction state of a database file.
** ^The [sqlite3_txn_state(D,S)] interface returns one of these
** constants in order to describe the transaction state of schema S
** in [database connection] D.
**
** &lt;dl&gt;
** [[SQLITE_TXN_NONE]] &lt;dt&gt;SQLITE_TXN_NONE&lt;/dt&gt;
** &lt;dd&gt;The SQLITE_TXN_NONE state means that no transaction is currently
** pending.&lt;/dd&gt;
**
** [[SQLITE_TXN_READ]] &lt;dt&gt;SQLITE_TXN_READ&lt;/dt&gt;
** &lt;dd&gt;The SQLITE_TXN_READ state means that the database is currently
** in a read transaction.  Content has been read from the database file
** but nothing in the database file has changed.  The transaction state
** will advanced to SQLITE_TXN_WRITE if any changes occur and there are
** no other conflicting concurrent write transactions.  The transaction
** state will revert to SQLITE_TXN_NONE following a [ROLLBACK] or
** [COMMIT].&lt;/dd&gt;
**
** [[SQLITE_TXN_WRITE]] &lt;dt&gt;SQLITE_TXN_WRITE&lt;/dt&gt;
** &lt;dd&gt;The SQLITE_TXN_WRITE state means that the database is currently
** in a write transaction.  Content has been written to the database file
** but has not yet committed.  The transaction state will change to
** to SQLITE_TXN_NONE at the next [ROLLBACK] or [COMMIT].&lt;/dd&gt;
