   * @enum:
   *   FT_OUTLINE_XXX
   *
   * @description:
   *   A list of bit-field constants used for the flags in an outline&apos;s
   *   `flags` field.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_OUTLINE_NONE ::
   *     Value~0 is reserved.
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_OWNER ::
   *     If set, this flag indicates that the outline&apos;s field arrays (i.e.,
   *     `points`, `flags`, and `contours`) are &apos;owned&apos; by the outline
   *     object, and should thus be freed when it is destroyed.
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_EVEN_ODD_FILL ::
   *     By default, outlines are filled using the non-zero winding rule.  If
   *     set to 1, the outline will be filled using the even-odd fill rule
   *     (only works with the smooth rasterizer).
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_REVERSE_FILL ::
   *     By default, outside contours of an outline are oriented in
   *     clock-wise direction, as defined in the TrueType specification.
   *     This flag is set if the outline uses the opposite direction
   *     (typically for Type~1 fonts).  This flag is ignored by the scan
   *     converter.
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS ::
   *     By default, the scan converter will try to detect drop-outs in an
   *     outline and correct the glyph bitmap to ensure consistent shape
   *     continuity.  If set, this flag hints the scan-line converter to
   *     ignore such cases.  See below for more information.
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_SMART_DROPOUTS ::
   *     Select smart dropout control.  If unset, use simple dropout control.
   *     Ignored if @FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS is set.  See below for more
   *     information.
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_INCLUDE_STUBS ::
   *     If set, turn pixels on for &apos;stubs&apos;, otherwise exclude them.  Ignored
   *     if @FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS is set.  See below for more
   *     information.
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_HIGH_PRECISION ::
   *     This flag indicates that the scan-line converter should try to
   *     convert this outline to bitmaps with the highest possible quality.
   *     It is typically set for small character sizes.  Note that this is
   *     only a hint that might be completely ignored by a given
   *     scan-converter.
   *
   *   FT_OUTLINE_SINGLE_PASS ::
   *     This flag is set to force a given scan-converter to only use a
   *     single pass over the outline to render a bitmap glyph image.
   *     Normally, it is set for very large character sizes.  It is only a
   *     hint that might be completely ignored by a given scan-converter.
   *
   * @note:
   *   The flags @FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS, @FT_OUTLINE_SMART_DROPOUTS, and
   *   @FT_OUTLINE_INCLUDE_STUBS are ignored by the smooth rasterizer.
   *
   *   There exists a second mechanism to pass the drop-out mode to the B/W
   *   rasterizer; see the `tags` field in @FT_Outline.
   *
   *   Please refer to the description of the &apos;SCANTYPE&apos; instruction in the
   *   OpenType specification (in file `ttinst1.doc`) how simple drop-outs,
   *   smart drop-outs, and stubs are defined.
