<doc f='include/pcre2.h' l='785'>/* Define macros that generate width-specific names from generic versions. The
three-level macro scheme is necessary to get the macros expanded when we want
them to be. First we get the width from PCRE2_LOCAL_WIDTH, which is used for
generating three versions of everything below. After that, PCRE2_SUFFIX will be
re-defined to use PCRE2_CODE_UNIT_WIDTH, for use when macros such as
pcre2_compile are called by application code. */</doc>
