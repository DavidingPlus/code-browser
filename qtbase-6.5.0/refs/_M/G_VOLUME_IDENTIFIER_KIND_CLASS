 * G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_CLASS:
 *
 * The string used to obtain the volume class with g_volume_get_identifier().
 *
 * Known volume classes include `device`, `network`, and `loop`. Other
 * classes may be added in the future.
 *
 * This is intended to be used by applications to classify #GVolume
 * instances into different sections - for example a file manager or
 * file chooser can use this information to show `network` volumes under
 * a &quot;Network&quot; heading and `device` volumes under a &quot;Devices&quot; heading.
