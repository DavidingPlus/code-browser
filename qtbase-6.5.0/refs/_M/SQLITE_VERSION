** CAPI3REF: Compile-Time Library Version Numbers
**
** ^(The [SQLITE_VERSION] C preprocessor macro in the sqlite3.h header
** evaluates to a string literal that is the SQLite version in the
** format &quot;X.Y.Z&quot; where X is the major version number (always 3 for
** SQLite3) and Y is the minor version number and Z is the release number.)^
** ^(The [SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER] C preprocessor macro resolves to an integer
** with the value (X*1000000 + Y*1000 + Z) where X, Y, and Z are the same
** numbers used in [SQLITE_VERSION].)^
** The SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER for any given release of SQLite will also
** be larger than the release from which it is derived.  Either Y will
** be held constant and Z will be incremented or else Y will be incremented
** and Z will be reset to zero.
**
** Since [version 3.6.18] ([dateof:3.6.18]),
** SQLite source code has been stored in the
** &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fossil-scm.org/&quot;&gt;Fossil configuration management
** system&lt;/a&gt;.  ^The SQLITE_SOURCE_ID macro evaluates to
** a string which identifies a particular check-in of SQLite
** within its configuration management system.  ^The SQLITE_SOURCE_ID
** string contains the date and time of the check-in (UTC) and a SHA1
** or SHA3-256 hash of the entire source tree.  If the source code has
** been edited in any way since it was last checked in, then the last
** four hexadecimal digits of the hash may be modified.
