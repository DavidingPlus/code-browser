 * G_TYPE_IS_INTERFACE:
 * @type: A #GType value
 * 
 * Checks if @type is an interface type.
 * An interface type provides a pure API, the implementation
 * of which is provided by another type (which is then said to conform
 * to the interface).  GLib interfaces are somewhat analogous to Java
 * interfaces and C++ classes containing only pure virtual functions, 
 * with the difference that GType interfaces are not derivable (but see
 * g_type_interface_add_prerequisite() for an alternative).
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE on success
