 * G_TYPE_VARIANT:
 *
 * The fundamental type corresponding to #GVariant.
 *
 * All floating #GVariant instances passed through the #GType system are
 * consumed.
 * 
 * Note that callbacks in closures, and signal handlers
 * for signals of return type %G_TYPE_VARIANT, must never return floating
 * variants.
 *
 * Note: GLib 2.24 did include a boxed type with this name. It was replaced
 * with this fundamental type in 2.26.
 *
 * Since: 2.26
