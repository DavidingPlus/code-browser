 * Take the random-access index i and adjust it so that it points beyond
 * a code point. The input index points beyond any code unit
 * of a code point and is moved to point beyond the last code unit of the same
 * code point. i is never decremented.
 * In other words, if i points to a trail surrogate that is preceded by a matching
 * lead surrogate, then i is incremented. Otherwise it is not modified.
 * This can be used to start an iteration with UTF_PREV_CHAR() from a random index.
 * Same as UTF16_SET_CHAR_LIMIT.
 * \pre start&lt;i&lt;=length
 * \post start&lt;i&lt;=length
 *
 * @deprecated ICU 2.4. Renamed to U16_SET_CP_LIMIT, see utf_old.h.
