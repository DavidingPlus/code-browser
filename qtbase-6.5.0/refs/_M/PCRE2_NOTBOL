<doc f='include/pcre2.h' l='163'>/* These are for pcre2_match(), pcre2_dfa_match(), pcre2_jit_match(), and
pcre2_substitute(). Some are allowed only for one of the functions, and in
these cases it is noted below. Note that PCRE2_ANCHORED, PCRE2_ENDANCHORED and
PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK can also be passed to these functions (though
pcre2_jit_match() ignores the latter since it bypasses all sanity checks). */</doc>
