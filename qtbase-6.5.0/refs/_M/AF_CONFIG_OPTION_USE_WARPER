   *
   * Compile &apos;autofit&apos; module with warp hinting.  The idea of the warping
   * code is to slightly scale and shift a glyph within a single dimension so
   * that as much of its segments are aligned (more or less) on the grid.  To
   * find out the optimal scaling and shifting value, various parameter
   * combinations are tried and scored.
   *
   * You can switch warping on and off with the `warping` property of the
   * auto-hinter (see file `ftdriver.h` for more information; by default it
   * is switched off).
   *
   * This experimental option is not active if the rendering mode is
   * `FT_RENDER_MODE_LIGHT`.
