 * g_renew:
 * @struct_type: the type of the elements to allocate
 * @mem: the currently allocated memory
 * @n_structs: the number of elements to allocate
 * 
 * Reallocates the memory pointed to by @mem, so that it now has space for
 * @n_structs elements of type @struct_type. It returns the new address of
 * the memory, which may have been moved.
 * Care is taken to avoid overflow when calculating the size of the allocated block.
 * 
 * Returns: a pointer to the new allocated memory, cast to a pointer to @struct_type
