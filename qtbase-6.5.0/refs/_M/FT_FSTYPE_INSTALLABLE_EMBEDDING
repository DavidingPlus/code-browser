   * @enum:
   *   FT_FSTYPE_XXX
   *
   * @description:
   *   A list of bit flags used in the `fsType` field of the OS/2 table in a
   *   TrueType or OpenType font and the `FSType` entry in a PostScript font.
   *   These bit flags are returned by @FT_Get_FSType_Flags; they inform
   *   client applications of embedding and subsetting restrictions
   *   associated with a font.
   *
   *   See
   *   https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/FontPolicies.pdf
   *   for more details.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_FSTYPE_INSTALLABLE_EMBEDDING ::
   *     Fonts with no fsType bit set may be embedded and permanently
   *     installed on the remote system by an application.
   *
   *   FT_FSTYPE_RESTRICTED_LICENSE_EMBEDDING ::
   *     Fonts that have only this bit set must not be modified, embedded or
   *     exchanged in any manner without first obtaining permission of the
   *     font software copyright owner.
   *
   *   FT_FSTYPE_PREVIEW_AND_PRINT_EMBEDDING ::
   *     The font may be embedded and temporarily loaded on the remote
   *     system.  Documents containing Preview &amp; Print fonts must be opened
   *     &apos;read-only&apos;; no edits can be applied to the document.
   *
   *   FT_FSTYPE_EDITABLE_EMBEDDING ::
   *     The font may be embedded but must only be installed temporarily on
   *     other systems.  In contrast to Preview &amp; Print fonts, documents
   *     containing editable fonts may be opened for reading, editing is
   *     permitted, and changes may be saved.
   *
   *   FT_FSTYPE_NO_SUBSETTING ::
   *     The font may not be subsetted prior to embedding.
   *
   *   FT_FSTYPE_BITMAP_EMBEDDING_ONLY ::
   *     Only bitmaps contained in the font may be embedded; no outline data
   *     may be embedded.  If there are no bitmaps available in the font,
   *     then the font is unembeddable.
   *
   * @note:
   *   The flags are ORed together, thus more than a single value can be
   *   returned.
   *
   *   While the `fsType` flags can indicate that a font may be embedded, a
   *   license with the font vendor may be separately required to use the
   *   font in this way.
