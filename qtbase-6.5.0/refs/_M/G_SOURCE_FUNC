 * G_SOURCE_FUNC:
 * @f: a function pointer.
 *
 * Cast a function pointer to a #GSourceFunc, suppressing warnings from GCC 8
 * onwards with `-Wextra` or `-Wcast-function-type` enabled about the function
 * types being incompatible.
 *
 * For example, the correct type of callback for a source created by
 * g_child_watch_source_new() is #GChildWatchFunc, which accepts more arguments
 * than #GSourceFunc. Casting the function with `(GSourceFunc)` to call
 * g_source_set_callback() will trigger a warning, even though it will be cast
 * back to the correct type before it is called by the source.
 *
 * Since: 2.58
