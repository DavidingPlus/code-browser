** CAPI3REF: Device Characteristics
**
** The xDeviceCharacteristics method of the [sqlite3_io_methods]
** object returns an integer which is a vector of these
** bit values expressing I/O characteristics of the mass storage
** device that holds the file that the [sqlite3_io_methods]
** refers to.
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
** any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
** mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
** are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
** nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
** that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
** first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
** way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
** information is written to disk in the same order as calls
** to xWrite().  The SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE property means that
** after reboot following a crash or power loss, the only bytes in a
** file that were written at the application level might have changed
** and that adjacent bytes, even bytes within the same sector are
** guaranteed to be unchanged.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_UNDELETABLE_WHEN_OPEN
** flag indicates that a file cannot be deleted when open.  The
** SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE flag indicates that the file is on
** read-only media and cannot be changed even by processes with
** elevated privileges.
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_BATCH_ATOMIC property means that the underlying
** filesystem supports doing multiple write operations atomically when those
** write operations are bracketed by [SQLITE_FCNTL_BEGIN_ATOMIC_WRITE] and
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE].
