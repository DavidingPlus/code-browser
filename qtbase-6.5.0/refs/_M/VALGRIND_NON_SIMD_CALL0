<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/testlib/3rdparty/valgrind_p.h' l='6827'>/* These requests allow control to move from the simulated CPU to the
   real CPU, calling an arbitrary function.
   
   Note that the current ThreadId is inserted as the first argument.
   So this call:

     VALGRIND_NON_SIMD_CALL2(f, arg1, arg2)

   requires f to have this signature:

     Word f(Word tid, Word arg1, Word arg2)

   where &quot;Word&quot; is a word-sized type.

   Note that these client requests are not entirely reliable.  For example,
   if you call a function with them that subsequently calls printf(),
   there&apos;s a high chance Valgrind will crash.  Generally, your prospects of
   these working are made higher if the called function does not refer to
   any global variables, and does not refer to any libc or other functions
   (printf et al).  Any kind of entanglement with libc or dynamic linking is
   likely to have a bad outcome, for tricky reasons which we&apos;ve grappled
   with a lot in the past.
