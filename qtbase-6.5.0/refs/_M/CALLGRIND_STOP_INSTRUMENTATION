   This flushes Valgrinds translation cache, and does no additional
   instrumentation afterwards, which effectivly will run at the same
   speed as the &quot;none&quot; tool (ie. at minimal slowdown).
   Use this to bypass Callgrind aggregation for uninteresting code parts.
   To start Callgrind in this mode to ignore the setup phase, use
   the option &quot;--instr-atstart=no&quot;. */</doc>
