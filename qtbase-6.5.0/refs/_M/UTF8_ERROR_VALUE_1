 * UTF8_ERROR_VALUE_1 and UTF8_ERROR_VALUE_2 are special error values for UTF-8,
 * which need 1 or 2 bytes in UTF-8:
 * \code
 * U+0015 = NAK = Negative Acknowledge, C0 control character
 * U+009f = highest C1 control character
 * \endcode
 *
 * These are used by UTF8_..._SAFE macros so that they can return an error value
 * that needs the same number of code units (bytes) as were seen by
 * a macro. They should be tested with UTF_IS_ERROR() or UTF_IS_VALID().
 *
 * @deprecated ICU 2.4. Obsolete, see utf_old.h.
