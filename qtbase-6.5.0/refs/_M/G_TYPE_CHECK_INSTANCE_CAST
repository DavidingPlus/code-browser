 * G_TYPE_CHECK_INSTANCE_CAST:
 * @instance: (nullable): Location of a #GTypeInstance structure
 * @g_type: The type to be returned
 * @c_type: The corresponding C type of @g_type
 * 
 * Checks that @instance is an instance of the type identified by @g_type
 * and issues a warning if this is not the case. Returns @instance casted 
 * to a pointer to @c_type.
 *
 * No warning will be issued if @instance is %NULL, and %NULL will be returned.
 * 
 * This macro should only be used in type implementations.
