** CAPI3REF: Flags for the xAccess VFS method
**
** These integer constants can be used as the third parameter to
** the xAccess method of an [sqlite3_vfs] object.  They determine
** what kind of permissions the xAccess method is looking for.
** With SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS, the xAccess method
** simply checks whether the file exists.
** With SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE, the xAccess method
** checks whether the named directory is both readable and writable
** (in other words, if files can be added, removed, and renamed within
** the directory).
** The SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE constant is currently used only by the
** [temp_store_directory pragma], though this could change in a future
** release of SQLite.
** With SQLITE_ACCESS_READ, the xAccess method
** checks whether the file is readable.  The SQLITE_ACCESS_READ constant is
** currently unused, though it might be used in a future release of
** SQLite.
