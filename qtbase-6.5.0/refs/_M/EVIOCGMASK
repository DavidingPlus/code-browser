 * EVIOCGMASK - Retrieve current event mask
 *
 * This ioctl allows user to retrieve the current event mask for specific
 * event type. The argument must be of type &quot;struct input_mask&quot; and
 * specifies the event type to query, the address of the receive buffer and
 * the size of the receive buffer.
 *
 * The event mask is a per-client mask that specifies which events are
 * forwarded to the client. Each event code is represented by a single bit
 * in the event mask. If the bit is set, the event is passed to the client
 * normally. Otherwise, the event is filtered and will never be queued on
 * the client&apos;s receive buffer.
 *
 * Event masks do not affect global state of the input device. They only
 * affect the file descriptor they are applied to.
 *
 * The default event mask for a client has all bits set, i.e. all events
 * are forwarded to the client. If the kernel is queried for an unknown
 * event type or if the receive buffer is larger than the number of
 * event codes known to the kernel, the kernel returns all zeroes for those
 * codes.
 *
 * At maximum, codes_size bytes are copied.
 *
 * This ioctl may fail with ENODEV in case the file is revoked, EFAULT
 * if the receive-buffer points to invalid memory, or EINVAL if the kernel
 * does not implement the ioctl.
