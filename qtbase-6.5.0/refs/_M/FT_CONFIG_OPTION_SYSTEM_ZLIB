   *
   * ZLib library selection
   *
   *   This macro is only used when `FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_ZLIB` is defined.
   *   It allows FreeType&apos;s &apos;ftgzip&apos; component to link to the system&apos;s
   *   installation of the ZLib library.  This is useful on systems like
   *   Unix or VMS where it generally is already available.
   *
   *   If you let it undefined, the component will use its own copy of the
   *   zlib sources instead.  These have been modified to be included
   *   directly within the component and **not** export external function
   *   names.  This allows you to link any program with FreeType _and_ ZLib
   *   without linking conflicts.
   *
   *   Do not `#undef` this macro here since the build system might define
   *   it for certain configurations only.
   *
   *   If you use a build system like cmake or the `configure` script,
   *   options set by those programs have precedence, overwriting the value
   *   here with the configured one.
