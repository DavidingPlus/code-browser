 * Inode flags (FS_IOC_GETFLAGS / FS_IOC_SETFLAGS)
 *
 * Note: for historical reasons, these flags were originally used and
 * defined for use by ext2/ext3, and then other file systems started
 * using these flags so they wouldn&apos;t need to write their own version
 * of chattr/lsattr (which was shipped as part of e2fsprogs).  You
 * should think twice before trying to use these flags in new
 * contexts, or trying to assign these flags, since they are used both
 * as the UAPI and the on-disk encoding for ext2/3/4.  Also, we are
 * almost out of 32-bit flags.  :-)
 *
 * We have recently hoisted FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR / FS_IOC_FSSETXATTR from
 * XFS to the generic FS level interface.  This uses a structure that
 * has padding and hence has more room to grow, so it may be more
 * appropriate for many new use cases.
 *
 * Please do not change these flags or interfaces before checking with
 * linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org and linux-api@vger.kernel.org.
