    * whole PNG data stream to *memory and updates *memory_bytes with the count
    * of bytes written.
    *
    * &apos;memory&apos; may be NULL.  In this case *memory_bytes is not read however on
    * success the number of bytes which would have been written will still be
    * stored in *memory_bytes.  On failure *memory_bytes will contain 0.
    *
    * If &apos;memory&apos; is not NULL it must point to memory[*memory_bytes] of
    * writeable memory.
    *
    * If the function returns success memory[*memory_bytes] (if &apos;memory&apos; is not
    * NULL) contains the written PNG data.  *memory_bytes will always be less
    * than or equal to the original value.
    *
    * If the function returns false and *memory_bytes was not changed an error
    * occurred during write.  If *memory_bytes was changed, or is not 0 if
    * &apos;memory&apos; was NULL, the write would have succeeded but for the memory
    * buffer being too small.  *memory_bytes contains the required number of
    * bytes and will be bigger that the original value.
