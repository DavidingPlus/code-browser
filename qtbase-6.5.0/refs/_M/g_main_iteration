 * g_main_iteration:
 * @may_block: set to %TRUE if it should block (i.e. wait) until an event
 *     source becomes ready. It will return after an event source has been
 *     processed. If set to %FALSE it will return immediately if no event
 *     source is ready to be processed.
 *
 * Runs a single iteration for the default #GMainContext.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if more events are pending.
 *
 * Deprecated: 2.2: Use g_main_context_iteration() instead.
