** CAPI3REF: Flags for sqlite3_deserialize()
**
** The following are allowed values for 6th argument (the F argument) to
** the [sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F)] interface.
**
** The SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE means that the database serialization
** in the P argument is held in memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc64()]
** and that SQLite should take ownership of this memory and automatically
** free it when it has finished using it.  Without this flag, the caller
** is responsible for freeing any dynamically allocated memory.
**
** The SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE flag means that SQLite is allowed to
** grow the size of the database using calls to [sqlite3_realloc64()].  This
** flag should only be used if SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE is also used.
** Without this flag, the deserialized database cannot increase in size beyond
** the number of bytes specified by the M parameter.
**
** The SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY flag means that the deserialized database
** should be treated as read-only.
