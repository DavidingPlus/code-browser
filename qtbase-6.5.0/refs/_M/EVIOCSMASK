 * EVIOCSMASK - Set event mask
 *
 * This ioctl is the counterpart to EVIOCGMASK. Instead of receiving the
 * current event mask, this changes the client&apos;s event mask for a specific
 * type.  See EVIOCGMASK for a description of event-masks and the
 * argument-type.
 *
 * This ioctl provides full forward compatibility. If the passed event type
 * is unknown to the kernel, or if the number of event codes specified in
 * the mask is bigger than what is known to the kernel, the ioctl is still
 * accepted and applied. However, any unknown codes are left untouched and
 * stay cleared. That means, the kernel always filters unknown codes
 * regardless of what the client requests.  If the new mask doesn&apos;t cover
 * all known event-codes, all remaining codes are automatically cleared and
 * thus filtered.
 *
 * This ioctl may fail with ENODEV in case the file is revoked. EFAULT is
 * returned if the receive-buffer points to invalid memory. EINVAL is returned
 * if the kernel does not implement the ioctl.
