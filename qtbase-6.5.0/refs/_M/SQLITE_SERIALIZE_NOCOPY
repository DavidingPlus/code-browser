** CAPI3REF: Flags for sqlite3_serialize
**
** Zero or more of the following constants can be OR-ed together for
** the F argument to [sqlite3_serialize(D,S,P,F)].
**
** SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY means that [sqlite3_serialize()] will return
** a pointer to contiguous in-memory database that it is currently using,
** without making a copy of the database.  If SQLite is not currently using
** a contiguous in-memory database, then this option causes
** [sqlite3_serialize()] to return a NULL pointer.  SQLite will only be
** using a contiguous in-memory database if it has been initialized by a
** prior call to [sqlite3_deserialize()].
