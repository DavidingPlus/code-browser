   *
   * Glyph Postscript Names handling
   *
   *   By default, FreeType 2 is compiled with the &apos;psnames&apos; module.  This
   *   module is in charge of converting a glyph name string into a Unicode
   *   value, or return a Macintosh standard glyph name for the use with the
   *   TrueType &apos;post&apos; table.
   *
   *   Undefine this macro if you do not want &apos;psnames&apos; compiled in your
   *   build of FreeType.  This has the following effects:
   *
   *   - The TrueType driver will provide its own set of glyph names, if you
   *     build it to support postscript names in the TrueType &apos;post&apos; table,
   *     but will not synthesize a missing Unicode charmap.
   *
   *   - The Type~1 driver will not be able to synthesize a Unicode charmap
   *     out of the glyphs found in the fonts.
   *
   *   You would normally undefine this configuration macro when building a
   *   version of FreeType that doesn&apos;t contain a Type~1 or CFF driver.
