** CAPI3REF: Flags for the xShmLock VFS method
**
** These integer constants define the various locking operations
** allowed by the xShmLock method of [sqlite3_io_methods].  The
** following are the only legal combinations of flags to the
** xShmLock method:
**
** &lt;ul&gt;
** &lt;li&gt;  SQLITE_SHM_LOCK | SQLITE_SHM_SHARED
** &lt;li&gt;  SQLITE_SHM_LOCK | SQLITE_SHM_EXCLUSIVE
** &lt;li&gt;  SQLITE_SHM_UNLOCK | SQLITE_SHM_SHARED
** &lt;li&gt;  SQLITE_SHM_UNLOCK | SQLITE_SHM_EXCLUSIVE
** &lt;/ul&gt;
**
** When unlocking, the same SHARED or EXCLUSIVE flag must be supplied as
** was given on the corresponding lock.
**
** The xShmLock method can transition between unlocked and SHARED or
** between unlocked and EXCLUSIVE.  It cannot transition between SHARED
** and EXCLUSIVE.
