 * G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_SORT_ORDER:
 *
 * A key in the &quot;standard&quot; namespace for setting the sort order of a file.
 * Corresponding #GFileAttributeType is %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_INT32.
 * An example use would be in file managers, which would use this key
 * to set the order files are displayed. Files with smaller sort order
 * should be sorted first, and files without sort order as if sort order
 * was zero.
