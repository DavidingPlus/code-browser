** CAPI3REF: Synchronization Type Flags
**
** When SQLite invokes the xSync() method of an
** [sqlite3_io_methods] object it uses a combination of
** these integer values as the second argument.
**
** When the SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY flag is used, it means that the
** sync operation only needs to flush data to mass storage.  Inode
** information need not be flushed. If the lower four bits of the flag
** equal SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL, that means to use normal fsync() semantics.
** If the lower four bits equal SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, that means
** to use Mac OS X style fullsync instead of fsync().
**
** Do not confuse the SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags
** with the [PRAGMA synchronous]=NORMAL and [PRAGMA synchronous]=FULL
** settings.  The [synchronous pragma] determines when calls to the
** xSync VFS method occur and applies uniformly across all platforms.
** The SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL flags determine how
** energetic or rigorous or forceful the sync operations are and
** only make a difference on Mac OSX for the default SQLite code.
** (Third-party VFS implementations might also make the distinction
** between SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL and SQLITE_SYNC_FULL, but among the
** operating systems natively supported by SQLite, only Mac OSX
** cares about the difference.)
