<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/corelib/global/qcompilerdetection.h' l='1148'>// This macro can be used to calculate member offsets for types with a non standard layout.
// It uses the fact that offsetof() is allowed to support those types since C++17 as an optional
// feature. All our compilers do support this, but some issue a warning, so we wrap the offsetof()
// call in a macro that disables the compiler warning.</doc>
