<doc f='include/dbus-1.0/dbus/dbus-protocol.h' l='193'>/** Max length of a marshaled array in bytes (64M, 2^26) We use signed
 * int for lengths so must be INT_MAX or less.  We need something a
 * bit smaller than INT_MAX because the array is inside a message with
 * header info, etc.  so an INT_MAX array wouldn&apos;t allow the message
 * overhead.  The 64M number is an attempt at a larger number than
 * we&apos;d reasonably ever use, but small enough that your bus would chew
 * through it fairly quickly without locking up forever. If you have
 * data that&apos;s likely to be larger than this, you should probably be
 * sending it in multiple incremental messages anyhow.
