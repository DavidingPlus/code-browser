 * Counts the trail bytes for a UTF-8 lead byte.
 * Returns 0 for 0..0xc1 as well as for 0xf5..0xff.
 * leadByte might be evaluated multiple times.
 *
 * This is internal since it is not meant to be called directly by external clients;
 * however it is called by public macros in this file and thus must remain stable.
 *
 * @param leadByte The first byte of a UTF-8 sequence. Must be 0..0xff.
