 * g_new:
 * @struct_type: the type of the elements to allocate
 * @n_structs: the number of elements to allocate
 * 
 * Allocates @n_structs elements of type @struct_type.
 * The returned pointer is cast to a pointer to the given type.
 * If @n_structs is 0 it returns %NULL.
 * Care is taken to avoid overflow when calculating the size of the allocated block.
 * 
 * Since the returned pointer is already casted to the right type,
 * it is normally unnecessary to cast it explicitly, and doing
 * so might hide memory allocation errors.
 * 
 * Returns: a pointer to the allocated memory, cast to a pointer to @struct_type
