   way, so you can safely call this multiple times provided that
   VALGRIND_ENABLE_ERROR_REPORTING is called the same number of times
   to re-enable reporting.  The first call of this macro disables
   reporting.  Subsequent calls have no effect except to increase the
   number of VALGRIND_ENABLE_ERROR_REPORTING calls needed to re-enable
   reporting.  Child threads do not inherit this setting from their
   parents -- they are always created with reporting enabled. */</doc>
