 * g_try_renew:
 * @struct_type: the type of the elements to allocate
 * @mem: the currently allocated memory
 * @n_structs: the number of elements to allocate
 * 
 * Attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by @mem, so that it now has
 * space for @n_structs elements of type @struct_type, and returns %NULL on
 * failure. Contrast with g_renew(), which aborts the program on failure.
 * It returns the new address of the memory, which may have been moved.
 * The function returns %NULL if an overflow occurs.
 * 
 * Since: 2.8
 * Returns: a pointer to the new allocated memory, cast to a pointer to @struct_type
