 * g_utf8_next_char:
 * @p: Pointer to the start of a valid UTF-8 character
 *
 * Skips to the next character in a UTF-8 string. The string must be
 * valid; this macro is as fast as possible, and has no error-checking.
 * You would use this macro to iterate over a string character by
 * character. The macro returns the start of the next UTF-8 character.
 * Before using this macro, use g_utf8_validate() to validate strings
 * that may contain invalid UTF-8.
