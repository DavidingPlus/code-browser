 * Adjust each titlecasing BreakIterator index to the next cased character.
 * (See the Unicode Standard, chapter 3, Default Case Conversion, R3 toTitlecase(X).)
 * Option bit for titlecasing APIs that take an options bit set.
 *
 * This used to be the default index adjustment in ICU.
 * Since ICU 60, the default index adjustment is to the next character that is
 * a letter, number, symbol, or private use code point.
 * (Uncased modifier letters are skipped.)
 * The difference in behavior is small for word titlecasing,
 * but the new adjustment is much better for whole-string and sentence titlecasing:
 * It yields &quot;49ers&quot; and &quot;«丰(abc)»&quot; instead of &quot;49Ers&quot; and &quot;«丰(Abc)»&quot;.
 *
 * It is an error to specify multiple titlecasing adjustment options together.
