** CAPI3REF: Flags For File Open Operations
**
** These bit values are intended for use in the
** 3rd parameter to the [sqlite3_open_v2()] interface and
** in the 4th parameter to the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method.
**
** Only those flags marked as &quot;Ok for sqlite3_open_v2()&quot; may be
** used as the third argument to the [sqlite3_open_v2()] interface.
** The other flags have historically been ignored by sqlite3_open_v2(),
** though future versions of SQLite might change so that an error is
** raised if any of the disallowed bits are passed into sqlite3_open_v2().
** Applications should not depend on the historical behavior.
**
** Note in particular that passing the SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag into
** [sqlite3_open_v2()] does *not* cause the underlying database file
** to be opened using O_EXCL.  Passing SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE into
** [sqlite3_open_v2()] has historically be a no-op and might become an
** error in future versions of SQLite.
