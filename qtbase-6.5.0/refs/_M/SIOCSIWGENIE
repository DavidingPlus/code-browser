 * This ioctl uses struct iw_point and data buffer that includes IE id and len
 * fields. More than one IE may be included in the request. Setting the generic
 * IE to empty buffer (len=0) removes the generic IE from the driver. Drivers
 * are allowed to generate their own WPA/RSN IEs, but in these cases, drivers
 * are required to report the used IE as a wireless event, e.g., when
 * associating with an AP. */</doc>
