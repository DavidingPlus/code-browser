    * larger but will be produced significantly faster, particular for large
    * images.  Do not use this option for images which will be distributed, only
    * used it when producing intermediate files that will be read back in
    * repeatedly.  For a typical 24-bit image the option will double the read
    * speed at the cost of increasing the image size by 25%, however for many
    * more compressible images the PNG file can be 10 times larger with only a
    * slight speed gain.
