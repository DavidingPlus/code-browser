 * G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE:
 *
 * Use this for high priority idle functions.
 *
 * GTK+ uses #G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE + 10 for resizing operations,
 * and #G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE + 20 for redrawing operations. (This is
 * done to ensure that any pending resizes are processed before any
 * pending redraws, so that widgets are not redrawn twice unnecessarily.)
