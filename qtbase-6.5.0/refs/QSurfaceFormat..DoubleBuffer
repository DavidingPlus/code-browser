<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/kernel/qsurfaceformat.cpp' l='135'>\value DoubleBuffer This is typically the default swap behaviour on desktop platforms,
        consisting of one back buffer and one front buffer. Rendering is done to the back
        buffer, and then the back buffer and front buffer are swapped, or the contents of
        the back buffer are copied to the front buffer, depending on the implementation.
