    \fn void QPlatformSharedGraphicsCache::itemsInvalidated(const QByteArray &amp;cacheId, const QList&lt;quint32&gt; &amp;itemIds)

    This signal is emitted when the items given by \a itemIds in the cache named \a cacheId have
    been removed from the cache and the previously reported information about them is considered
    invalid. It will only be emitted for items for which a buffer has previously been identified
    through the itemsAvailable() signal (either as response to a requestItems() call or an
    insertItems() call.)

    The application is expected to throw away information about the items in the \a itemIds array
    and drop any references it might have to the memory held by the buffer. If the items are still
    required by the application, it can re-commit them to the cache using the insertItems() function.

    If the application no longer holds any references to previously referenced items in a given
    cache, it should call releaseItems() for these items, at which point it will no longer receive
    any itemsInvalidated() signal for these items.
