    \fn void QRhiBuffer::setSize(int sz)

    Sets the size of the buffer in bytes. The size is normally specified in
    QRhi::newBuffer() so this function is only used when the size has to be
    changed. As with other setters, the size only takes effect when calling
    create(), and for already created buffers this involves releasing the previous
    native resource and creating new ones under the hood.

    Backends may choose to allocate buffers bigger than \a sz in order to
    fulfill alignment requirements. This is hidden from the applications and
    size() will always report the size requested in \a sz.
