    Aborts a read transaction.

    This function is commonly used to discard the transaction after
    higher-level protocol errors or loss of stream synchronization.

    If called on an inner transaction, aborting is delegated to the outermost
    transaction, and subsequently started inner transactions are forced to
    fail.

    For the outermost transaction, discards the restoration point and any
    internally duplicated data of the stream. Will not affect the current
    read position of the stream.

    Sets the status of the data stream to \value ReadCorruptData.
