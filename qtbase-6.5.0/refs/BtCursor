** A cursor is a pointer to a particular entry within a particular
** b-tree within a database file.
**
** The entry is identified by its MemPage and the index in
** MemPage.aCell[] of the entry.
**
** A single database file can be shared by two more database connections,
** but cursors cannot be shared.  Each cursor is associated with a
** particular database connection identified BtCursor.pBtree.db.
**
** Fields in this structure are accessed under the BtShared.mutex
** found at self-&gt;pBt-&gt;mutex.
**
** skipNext meaning:
** The meaning of skipNext depends on the value of eState:
**
**   eState            Meaning of skipNext
**   VALID             skipNext is meaningless and is ignored
**   INVALID           skipNext is meaningless and is ignored
**   SKIPNEXT          sqlite3BtreeNext() is a no-op if skipNext&gt;0 and
**                     sqlite3BtreePrevious() is no-op if skipNext&lt;0.
**   REQUIRESEEK       restoreCursorPosition() restores the cursor to
**                     eState=SKIPNEXT if skipNext!=0
**   FAULT             skipNext holds the cursor fault error code.
