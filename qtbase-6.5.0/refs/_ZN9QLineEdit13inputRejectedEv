    This signal is emitted when the user presses a key that is not
    considered to be acceptable input. For example, if a key press
    results in a validator&apos;s validate() call to return Invalid.
    Another case is when trying to enter in more characters beyond the
    maximum length of the line edit.

    Note: This signal will still be emitted in a case where part of
    the text is accepted but not all of it is. For example, if there
    is a maximum length set and the clipboard text is longer than the
    maximum length when it is pasted.
