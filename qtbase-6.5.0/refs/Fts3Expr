** A tree of these objects forms the RHS of a MATCH operator.
**
** If Fts3Expr.eType is FTSQUERY_PHRASE and isLoaded is true, then aDoclist
** points to a malloced buffer, size nDoclist bytes, containing the results
** of this phrase query in FTS3 doclist format. As usual, the initial
** &quot;Length&quot; field found in doclists stored on disk is omitted from this
** buffer.
**
** Variable aMI is used only for FTSQUERY_NEAR nodes to store the global
** matchinfo data. If it is not NULL, it points to an array of size nCol*3,
** where nCol is the number of columns in the queried FTS table. The array
** is populated as follows:
**
**   aMI[iCol*3 + 0] = Undefined
**   aMI[iCol*3 + 1] = Number of occurrences
**   aMI[iCol*3 + 2] = Number of rows containing at least one instance
**
** The aMI array is allocated using sqlite3_malloc(). It should be freed
** when the expression node is.
