    Redirects the process&apos; standard input to the file indicated by \a
    fileName. When an input redirection is in place, the QProcess
    object will be in read-only mode (calling write() will result in
    error).

    To make the process read EOF right away, pass nullDevice() here.
    This is cleaner than using closeWriteChannel() before writing any
    data, because it can be set up prior to starting the process.

    If the file \a fileName does not exist at the moment start() is
    called or is not readable, starting the process will fail.

    Calling setStandardInputFile() after the process has started has no
    effect.
