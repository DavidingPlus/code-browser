    Returns a list of unknown option names.

    This list will include both long an short name options that were not
    recognized. For any long options that were in the form {--option=value},
    the value part will have been dropped and only the long name is added.

    The names in this list do not include the preceding dash characters.
    Names may appear more than once in this list if they were encountered
    more than once by the parser.
