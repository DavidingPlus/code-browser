    Grabs the keyboard input.

    The item will receive all keyboard input to the scene until one of the
    following events occur:

    \list
    \li The item becomes invisible
    \li The item is removed from the scene
    \li The item is deleted
    \li The item calls ungrabKeyboard()
    \li Another item calls grabKeyboard(); the item will regain the keyboard grab
    when the other item calls ungrabKeyboard().
    \endlist

    When an item gains the keyboard grab, it receives a QEvent::GrabKeyboard
    event. When it loses the keyboard grab, it receives a
    QEvent::UngrabKeyboard event. These events can be used to detect when your
    item gains or loses the keyboard grab through other means than gaining
    input focus.

    It is almost never necessary to explicitly grab the keyboard in Qt, as Qt
    grabs and releases it sensibly. In particular, Qt grabs the keyboard when
    your item gains input focus, and releases it when your item loses input
    focus, or when the item is hidden.

    Note that only visible items can grab keyboard input. Calling
    grabKeyboard() on an invisible item has no effect.

    Keyboard events are not affected.
