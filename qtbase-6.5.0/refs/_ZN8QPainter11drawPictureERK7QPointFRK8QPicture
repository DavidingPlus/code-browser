    \fn void QPainter::drawPicture(const QPointF &amp;point, const QPicture &amp;picture)

    Replays the given \a picture at the given \a point.

    The QPicture class is a paint device that records and replays
    QPainter commands. A picture serializes the painter commands to an
    IO device in a platform-independent format. Everything that can be
    painted on a widget or pixmap can also be stored in a picture.

    This function does exactly the same as QPicture::play() when
    called with \a point = QPointF(0, 0).

    \note The state of the painter is preserved by this function.
