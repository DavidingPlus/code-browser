    \property QGraphicsAnchor::sizePolicy
    \brief the size policy for the QGraphicsAnchor.

    By setting the size policy on an anchor you can configure how the anchor can resize itself
    from its preferred spacing. For instance, if the anchor has the size policy
    QSizePolicy::Minimum, the spacing is the minimum size of the anchor. However, its size
    can grow up to the anchors maximum size. If the default size policy is QSizePolicy::Fixed,
    the anchor can neither grow or shrink, which means that the only size the anchor can have
    is the spacing. QSizePolicy::Fixed is the default size policy.
    QGraphicsAnchor always has a minimum spacing of 0 and a very large maximum spacing.

    \sa QGraphicsAnchor::spacing
