    Begins a column move operation.

    When reimplementing a subclass, this method simplifies moving
    entities in your model. This method is responsible for moving
    persistent indexes in the model, which you would otherwise be
    required to do yourself. Using beginMoveColumns and endMoveColumns
    is an alternative to emitting layoutAboutToBeChanged and
    layoutChanged directly along with changePersistentIndex.

    The \a sourceParent index corresponds to the parent from which the
    columns are moved; \a sourceFirst and \a sourceLast are the first and last
    column numbers of the columns to be moved. The \a destinationParent index
    corresponds to the parent into which those columns are moved. The \a
    destinationChild is the column to which the columns will be moved.  That
    is, the index at column \a sourceFirst in \a sourceParent will become
    column \a destinationChild in \a destinationParent, followed by all other
    columns up to \a sourceLast.

    However, when moving columns down in the same parent (\a sourceParent
    and \a destinationParent are equal), the columns will be placed before the
    \a destinationChild index. That is, if you wish to move columns 0 and 1 so
    they will become columns 1 and 2, \a destinationChild should be 3. In this
    case, the new index for the source column \c i (which is between
    \a sourceFirst and \a sourceLast) is equal to
    \c {(destinationChild-sourceLast-1+i)}.

    Note that if \a sourceParent and \a destinationParent are the same,
    you must ensure that the \a destinationChild is not within the range
    of \a sourceFirst and \a sourceLast + 1.  You must also ensure that you
    do not attempt to move a column to one of its own children or ancestors.
    This method returns \c{false} if either condition is true, in which case you
    should abort your move operation.
