** Each instance of this object holds a sequence of WhereLoop objects
** that implement some or all of a query plan.
**
** Think of each WhereLoop object as a node in a graph with arcs
** showing dependencies and costs for travelling between nodes.  (That is
** not a completely accurate description because WhereLoop costs are a
** vector, not a scalar, and because dependencies are many-to-one, not
** one-to-one as are graph nodes.  But it is a useful visualization aid.)
** Then a WherePath object is a path through the graph that visits some
** or all of the WhereLoop objects once.
**
** The &quot;solver&quot; works by creating the N best WherePath objects of length
** 1.  Then using those as a basis to compute the N best WherePath objects
** of length 2.  And so forth until the length of WherePaths equals the
** number of nodes in the FROM clause.  The best (lowest cost) WherePath
** at the end is the chosen query plan.
