 *
 * &apos;\\&apos;: Maybe escape sequence.
 * &apos;\0&apos;: NULL char.
 *  &apos;*&apos;: Maybe (strong) emphasis start/end.
 *  &apos;_&apos;: Maybe (strong) emphasis start/end.
 *  &apos;~&apos;: Maybe strikethrough start/end (needs MD_FLAG_STRIKETHROUGH).
 *  &apos;`&apos;: Maybe code span start/end.
 *  &apos;&amp;&apos;: Maybe start of entity.
 *  &apos;;&apos;: Maybe end of entity.
 *  &apos;&lt;&apos;: Maybe start of raw HTML or autolink.
 *  &apos;&gt;&apos;: Maybe end of raw HTML or autolink.
 *  &apos;[&apos;: Maybe start of link label or link text.
 *  &apos;!&apos;: Equivalent of &apos;[&apos; for image.
 *  &apos;]&apos;: Maybe end of link label or link text.
 *  &apos;@&apos;: Maybe permissive e-mail auto-link (needs MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEEMAILAUTOLINKS).
 *  &apos;:&apos;: Maybe permissive URL auto-link (needs MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEURLAUTOLINKS).
 *  &apos;.&apos;: Maybe permissive WWW auto-link (needs MD_FLAG_PERMISSIVEWWWAUTOLINKS).
 *  &apos;D&apos;: Dummy mark, it reserves a space for splitting a previous mark
 *       (e.g. emphasis) or to make more space for storing some special data
 *       related to the preceding mark (e.g. link).
 *
 * Note that not all instances of these chars in the text imply creation of the
 * structure. Only those which have (or may have, after we see more context)
 * the special meaning.
 *
 * (Keep this struct as small as possible to fit as much of them into CPU
 * cache line.)
