 * Create a compose table for a given locale.
 *
 * The locale is used for searching the file-system for an appropriate
 * Compose file.  The search order is described in Compose(5).  It is
 * affected by the following environment variables:
 *
 * 1. `XCOMPOSEFILE` - see Compose(5).
 * 2. `HOME` - see Compose(5).
 * 3. `XLOCALEDIR` - if set, used as the base directory for the system&apos;s
 *    X locale files, e.g. `/usr/share/X11/locale`, instead of the
 *    preconfigured directory.
 *
 * @param context
 *     The library context in which to create the compose table.
 * @param locale
 *     The current locale.  See @ref compose-locale.
 *     \n
 *     The value is copied, so it is safe to pass the result of getenv(3)
 *     (or similar) without fear of it being invalidated by a subsequent
 *     setenv(3) (or similar).
 * @param flags
 *     Optional flags for the compose table, or 0.
 *
 * @returns A compose table for the given locale, or NULL if the
 * compilation failed or a Compose file was not found.
