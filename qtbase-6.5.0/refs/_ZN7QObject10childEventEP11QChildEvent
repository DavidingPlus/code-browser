    This event handler can be reimplemented in a subclass to receive
    child events. The event is passed in the \a event parameter.

    QEvent::ChildAdded and QEvent::ChildRemoved events are sent to
    objects when children are added or removed. In both cases you can
    only rely on the child being a QObject, or if isWidgetType()
    returns \c true, a QWidget. (This is because, in the
    \l{QEvent::ChildAdded}{ChildAdded} case, the child is not yet
    fully constructed, and in the \l{QEvent::ChildRemoved}{ChildRemoved}
    case it might have been destructed already).

    QEvent::ChildPolished events are sent to widgets when children
    are polished, or when polished children are added. If you receive
    a child polished event, the child&apos;s construction is usually
    completed. However, this is not guaranteed, and multiple polish
    events may be delivered during the execution of a widget&apos;s
    constructor.

    For every child widget, you receive one
    \l{QEvent::ChildAdded}{ChildAdded} event, zero or more
    \l{QEvent::ChildPolished}{ChildPolished} events, and one
    \l{QEvent::ChildRemoved}{ChildRemoved} event.

    The \l{QEvent::ChildPolished}{ChildPolished} event is omitted if
    a child is removed immediately after it is added. If a child is
    polished several times during construction and destruction, you
    may receive several child polished events for the same child,
    each time with a different virtual table.
