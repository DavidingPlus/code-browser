    Returns the slope of the path at the percentage \a t. The
    argument \a t has to be between 0 and 1.

    Note that similarly to other percent methods, the percentage measurement
    is not linear with regards to the length, if curves are present
    in the path. When curves are present the percentage argument is mapped
    to the t parameter of the Bezier equations.
