  \property QTreeView::autoExpandDelay
  \brief The delay time before items in a tree are opened during a drag and drop operation.
  \since 4.3

  This property holds the amount of time in milliseconds that the user must wait over
  a node before that node will automatically open or close.  If the time is
  set to less then 0 then it will not be activated.

  By default, this property has a value of -1, meaning that auto-expansion is disabled.
