   \fn QCborTag QCborStreamReader::toTag() const

   Returns the tag value of the current element.

   This function does not perform any type conversions, including from integer.
   Therefore, it may only be called if isTag() is true; calling it in any other
   condition is an error.

   Tags are 64-bit numbers attached to generic CBOR types that give them
   further meaning. For a list of known tags, see the \l QCborKnownTags
   enumeration.
