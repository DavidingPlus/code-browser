    \fn qint64 QTabletEvent::uniqueId() const
    \deprecated [6.0] Use pointingDevice().uniqueId() instead.

    Returns a unique ID for the current device, making it possible
    to differentiate between multiple devices being used at the same
    time on the tablet.

    Support of this feature is dependent on the tablet.

    Values for the same device may vary from OS to OS.

    Later versions of the Wacom driver for Linux will now report
    the ID information. If you have a tablet that supports unique ID
    and are not getting the information on Linux, consider upgrading
    your driver.

    As of Qt 4.2, the unique ID is the same regardless of the orientation
    of the pen. Earlier versions would report a different value when using
    the eraser-end versus the pen-end of the stylus on some OS&apos;s.
