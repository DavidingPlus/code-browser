** even though the WAL file contains other valid transactions.
**
** This function attempts to scan the WAL file associated with database zDb
** of database handle db and make all valid snapshots available to
** sqlite3_snapshot_open(). It is an error if there is already a read
** transaction open on the database, or if the database is not a WAL mode
** database.
**
** SQLITE_OK is returned if successful, or an SQLite error code otherwise.
**
** This interface is only available if SQLite is compiled with the
