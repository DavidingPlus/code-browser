    \fn void QPlatformSharedGraphicsCache::beginRequestBatch()

    This is a hint to the cache that a burst of requests is pending. In some implementations, this
    will improve performance, as the cache can focus on handling the requests and wait with the
    results until it is done. It should typically be called prior to a sequence of calls to
    requestItems() and releaseItems().

    Any call to beginRequestBatch() must be followed at some point by a call to endRequestBatch().
    Failing to do this may lead to the results of requests never being emitted.

    \note beginRequestBatch() and endRequestBatch() have no stacking logic. Calling
    beginRequestBatch() twice in a row has no effect, and the single existing batch will be ended
    by the earliest call to endRequestBatch().

    \sa endRequestBatch(), requestBatchStarted()
