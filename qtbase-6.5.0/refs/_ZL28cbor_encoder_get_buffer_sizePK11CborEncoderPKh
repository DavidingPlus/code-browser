 * \fn size_t cbor_encoder_get_buffer_size(const CborEncoder *encoder, const uint8_t *buffer)
 *
 * Returns the total size of the buffer starting at \a buffer after the
 * encoding finished without errors. The \a encoder and \a buffer arguments
 * must be the same as supplied to cbor_encoder_init().
 *
 * If the encoding process had errors, the return value of this function is
 * meaningless. If the only errors were CborErrorOutOfMemory, instead use
 * cbor_encoder_get_extra_bytes_needed() to find out by how much to grow the
 * buffer before encoding again.
 *
 * See \ref CborEncoding for an example of using this function.
