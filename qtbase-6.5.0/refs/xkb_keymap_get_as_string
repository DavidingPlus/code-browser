 * Get the compiled keymap as a string.
 *
 * @param keymap The keymap to get as a string.
 * @param format The keymap format to use for the string.  You can pass
 * in the special value XKB_KEYMAP_USE_ORIGINAL_FORMAT to use the format
 * from which the keymap was originally created.
 *
 * @returns The keymap as a NUL-terminated string, or NULL if unsuccessful.
 *
 * The returned string may be fed back into xkb_keymap_new_from_string() to get
 * the exact same keymap (possibly in another process, etc.).
 *
 * The returned string is dynamically allocated and should be freed by the
 * caller.
