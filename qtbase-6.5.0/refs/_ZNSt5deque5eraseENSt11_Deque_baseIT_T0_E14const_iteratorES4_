       *  @brief  Remove a range of elements.
       *  @param  __first  Iterator pointing to the first element to be erased.
       *  @param  __last  Iterator pointing to one past the last element to be
       *                erased.
       *  @return  An iterator pointing to the element pointed to by @a last
       *           prior to erasing (or end()).
       *
       *  This function will erase the elements in the range
       *  [__first,__last) and shorten the %deque accordingly.
       *
       *  The user is cautioned that
       *  this function only erases the elements, and that if the elements
       *  themselves are pointers, the pointed-to memory is not touched in any
       *  way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
