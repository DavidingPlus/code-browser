    \fn void QGraphicsWidget::setLayout(QGraphicsLayout *layout)

    Sets the layout for this widget to \a layout. Any existing layout manager
    is deleted before the new layout is assigned. If \a layout is \nullptr, the
    widget is left without a layout. Existing subwidgets&apos; geometries will
    remain unaffected.

    All widgets that are currently managed by \a layout or all of its
    sublayouts, are automatically reparented to this item. The layout is then
    invalidated, and the child widget geometries are adjusted according to
    this item&apos;s geometry() and contentsMargins(). Children who are not
    explicitly managed by \a layout remain unaffected by the layout after
    it has been assigned to this widget.

    QGraphicsWidget takes ownership of \a layout.
