    \deprecated

    If \a enabled is true, this item is set to handle all events for
    all its children (i.e., all events intended for any of its
    children are instead sent to this item); otherwise, if \a enabled
    is false, this item will only handle its own events. The default
    value is false.

    This property is useful for item groups; it allows one item to
    handle events on behalf of its children, as opposed to its
    children handling their events individually.

    If a child item accepts hover events, its parent will receive
    hover move events as the cursor passes through the child, but it
    does not receive hover enter and hover leave events on behalf of
    its child.
