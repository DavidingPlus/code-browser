    \since 4.5

    This function connects one of its signals to the slot specified by \a receiver
    and \a member. The specific signal depends on the arguments that are specified
    in \a member. These are:

    \list
      \li textValueSelected() if \a member has a QString for its first argument.
      \li intValueSelected() if \a member has an int for its first argument.
      \li doubleValueSelected() if \a member has a double for its first argument.
      \li accepted() if \a member has NO arguments.
    \endlist

    The signal will be disconnected from the slot when the dialog is closed.
