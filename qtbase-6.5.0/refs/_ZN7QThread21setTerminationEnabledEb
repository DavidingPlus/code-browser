    \fn void QThread::setTerminationEnabled(bool enabled)

    Enables or disables termination of the current thread based on the
    \a enabled parameter. The thread must have been started by
    QThread.

    When \a enabled is false, termination is disabled.  Future calls
    to QThread::terminate() will return immediately without effect.
    Instead, the termination is deferred until termination is enabled.

    When \a enabled is true, termination is enabled.  Future calls to
    QThread::terminate() will terminate the thread normally.  If
    termination has been deferred (i.e. QThread::terminate() was
    called with termination disabled), this function will terminate
    the calling thread \e immediately.  Note that this function will
    not return in this case.

    \sa terminate()
