   * @enum:
   *   FT_Glyph_Format
   *
   * @description:
   *   An enumeration type used to describe the format of a given glyph
   *   image.  Note that this version of FreeType only supports two image
   *   formats, even though future font drivers will be able to register
   *   their own format.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_GLYPH_FORMAT_NONE ::
   *     The value~0 is reserved.
   *
   *   FT_GLYPH_FORMAT_COMPOSITE ::
   *     The glyph image is a composite of several other images.  This format
   *     is _only_ used with @FT_LOAD_NO_RECURSE, and is used to report
   *     compound glyphs (like accented characters).
   *
   *   FT_GLYPH_FORMAT_BITMAP ::
   *     The glyph image is a bitmap, and can be described as an @FT_Bitmap.
   *     You generally need to access the `bitmap` field of the
   *     @FT_GlyphSlotRec structure to read it.
   *
   *   FT_GLYPH_FORMAT_OUTLINE ::
   *     The glyph image is a vectorial outline made of line segments and
   *     Bezier arcs; it can be described as an @FT_Outline; you generally
   *     want to access the `outline` field of the @FT_GlyphSlotRec structure
   *     to read it.
   *
   *   FT_GLYPH_FORMAT_PLOTTER ::
   *     The glyph image is a vectorial path with no inside and outside
   *     contours.  Some Type~1 fonts, like those in the Hershey family,
   *     contain glyphs in this format.  These are described as @FT_Outline,
   *     but FreeType isn&apos;t currently capable of rendering them correctly.
