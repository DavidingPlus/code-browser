 * Constants for ISO 15924 script codes.
 *
 * The current set of script code constants supports at least all scripts
 * that are encoded in the version of Unicode which ICU currently supports.
 * The names of the constants are usually derived from the
 * Unicode script property value aliases.
 * See UAX #24 Unicode Script Property (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/)
 * and http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/PropertyValueAliases.txt .
 *
 * In addition, constants for many ISO 15924 script codes
 * are included, for use with language tags, CLDR data, and similar.
 * Some of those codes are not used in the Unicode Character Database (UCD).
 * For example, there are no characters that have a UCD script property value of
 * Hans or Hant. All Han ideographs have the Hani script property value in Unicode.
 *
 * Private-use codes Qaaa..Qabx are not included, except as used in the UCD or in CLDR.
 *
 * Starting with ICU 55, script codes are only added when their scripts
 * have been or will certainly be encoded in Unicode,
 * and have been assigned Unicode script property value aliases,
 * to ensure that their script names are stable and match the names of the constants.
 * Script codes like Latf and Aran that are not subject to separate encoding
 * may be added at any time.
 *
 * @stable ICU 2.2
