    \fn double QLatin1StringView::toDouble(bool *ok) const
    \fn float QLatin1StringView::toFloat(bool *ok) const
    \since 6.4

    Returns this QLatin1StringView converted to a corresponding floating-point value.

    Returns an infinity if the conversion overflows or 0.0 if the
    conversion fails for other reasons (e.g. underflow).

    If \a ok is not \nullptr, failure is reported by setting *\a{ok}
    to \c false, and success by setting *\a{ok} to \c true.

    \warning The QLatin1StringView content may only contain valid numerical
    characters which includes the plus/minus sign, the character e used in
    scientific notation, and the decimal point. Including the unit or additional
    characters leads to a conversion error.
