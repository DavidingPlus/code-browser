    This signal is emitted when text is selected or de-selected in the
    text edit.

    When text is selected this signal will be emitted with \a yes set
    to true. If no text has been selected or if the selected text is
    de-selected this signal is emitted with \a yes set to false.

    If \a yes is true then copy() can be used to copy the selection to
    the clipboard. If \a yes is false then copy() does nothing.

    \sa selectionChanged()
