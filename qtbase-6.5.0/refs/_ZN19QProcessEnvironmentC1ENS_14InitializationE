    Creates an object that when set on QProcess will cause it to be executed with
    environment variables inherited from its parent process.

    \note The created object does not store any environment variables by itself,
    it just indicates to QProcess to arrange for inheriting the environment at the
    time when the new process is started. Adding any environment variables to
    the created object will disable inheritance of the environment and result in
    an environment containing only the added environment variables.

    If a modified version of the parent environment is wanted, start with the
    return value of \c systemEnvironment() and modify that (but note that changes to
    the parent process&apos;s environment after that is created won&apos;t be reflected
    in the modified environment).
