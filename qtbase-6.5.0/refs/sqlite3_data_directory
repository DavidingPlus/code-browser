** CAPI3REF: Name Of The Folder Holding Database Files
**
** ^(If this global variable is made to point to a string which is
** the name of a folder (a.k.a. directory), then all database files
** specified with a relative pathname and created or accessed by
** SQLite when using a built-in windows [sqlite3_vfs | VFS] will be assumed
** to be relative to that directory.)^ ^If this variable is a NULL
** pointer, then SQLite assumes that all database files specified
** with a relative pathname are relative to the current directory
** for the process.  Only the windows VFS makes use of this global
** variable; it is ignored by the unix VFS.
**
** Changing the value of this variable while a database connection is
** open can result in a corrupt database.
**
** It is not safe to read or modify this variable in more than one
** thread at a time.  It is not safe to read or modify this variable
** if a [database connection] is being used at the same time in a separate
** thread.
** It is intended that this variable be set once
** as part of process initialization and before any SQLite interface
** routines have been called and that this variable remain unchanged
** thereafter.
**
** ^The [data_store_directory pragma] may modify this variable and cause
** it to point to memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc].  ^Furthermore,
** the [data_store_directory pragma] always assumes that any string
** that this variable points to is held in memory obtained from
** [sqlite3_malloc] and the pragma may attempt to free that memory
** using [sqlite3_free].
** Hence, if this variable is modified directly, either it should be
** made NULL or made to point to memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc]
** or else the use of the [data_store_directory pragma] should be avoided.
