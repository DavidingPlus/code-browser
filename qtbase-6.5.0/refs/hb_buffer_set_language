 * hb_buffer_set_language:
 * @buffer: An #hb_buffer_t
 * @language: An hb_language_t to set
 *
 * Sets the language of @buffer to @language.
 *
 * Languages are crucial for selecting which OpenType feature to apply to the
 * buffer which can result in applying language-specific behaviour. Languages
 * are orthogonal to the scripts, and though they are related, they are
 * different concepts and should not be confused with each other.
 *
 * Use hb_language_from_string() to convert from BCP 47 language tags to
 * #hb_language_t.

 * Since: 0.9.2
