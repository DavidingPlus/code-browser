    This signal is emitted whenever the content of the document
    changes in a way that affects the modification state. If \a
    changed is true, the document has been modified; otherwise it is
    false.

    For example, calling setModified(false) on a document and then
    inserting text causes the signal to get emitted. If you undo that
    operation, causing the document to return to its original
    unmodified state, the signal will get emitted again.
