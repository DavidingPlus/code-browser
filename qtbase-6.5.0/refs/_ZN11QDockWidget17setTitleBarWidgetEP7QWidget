    Sets an arbitrary \a widget as the dock widget&apos;s title bar. If \a widget
    is \nullptr, any custom title bar widget previously set on the dock widget
    is removed, but not deleted, and the default title bar will be used
    instead.

    If a title bar widget is set, QDockWidget will not use native window
    decorations when it is floated.

    Here are some tips for implementing custom title bars:

    \list
    \li Mouse events that are not explicitly handled by the title bar widget
       must be ignored by calling QMouseEvent::ignore(). These events then
       propagate to the QDockWidget parent, which handles them in the usual
       manner, moving when the title bar is dragged, docking and undocking
       when it is double-clicked, etc.

    \li When DockWidgetVerticalTitleBar is set on QDockWidget, the title
       bar widget is repositioned accordingly. In resizeEvent(), the title
       bar should check what orientation it should assume:
       \snippet code/src_gui_widgets_qdockwidget.cpp 0

    \li The title bar widget must have a valid QWidget::sizeHint() and
       QWidget::minimumSizeHint(). These functions should take into account
       the current orientation of the title bar.

    \li It is not possible to remove a title bar from a dock widget. However,
       a similar effect can be achieved by setting a default constructed
       QWidget as the title bar widget.
    \endlist

    Using qobject_cast() as shown above, the title bar widget has full access
    to its parent QDockWidget. Hence it can perform such operations as docking
    and hiding in response to user actions.
