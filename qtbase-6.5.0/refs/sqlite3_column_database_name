** CAPI3REF: Source Of Data In A Query Result
** METHOD: sqlite3_stmt
**
** ^These routines provide a means to determine the database, table, and
** table column that is the origin of a particular result column in
** [SELECT] statement.
** ^The name of the database or table or column can be returned as
** either a UTF-8 or UTF-16 string.  ^The _database_ routines return
** the database name, the _table_ routines return the table name, and
** the origin_ routines return the column name.
** ^The returned string is valid until the [prepared statement] is destroyed
** using [sqlite3_finalize()] or until the statement is automatically
** reprepared by the first call to [sqlite3_step()] for a particular run
** or until the same information is requested
** again in a different encoding.
**
** ^The names returned are the original un-aliased names of the
** database, table, and column.
**
** ^The first argument to these interfaces is a [prepared statement].
** ^These functions return information about the Nth result column returned by
** the statement, where N is the second function argument.
** ^The left-most column is column 0 for these routines.
**
** ^If the Nth column returned by the statement is an expression or
** subquery and is not a column value, then all of these functions return
** NULL.  ^These routines might also return NULL if a memory allocation error
** occurs.  ^Otherwise, they return the name of the attached database, table,
** or column that query result column was extracted from.
**
** ^As with all other SQLite APIs, those whose names end with &quot;16&quot; return
** UTF-16 encoded strings and the other functions return UTF-8.
**
** ^These APIs are only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA] C-preprocessor symbol.
**
** If two or more threads call one or more
** [sqlite3_column_database_name | column metadata interfaces]
** for the same [prepared statement] and result column
** at the same time then the results are undefined.
