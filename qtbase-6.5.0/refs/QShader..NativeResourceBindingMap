    \typedef QShader::NativeResourceBindingMap

    Synonym for QMap&lt;int, QPair&lt;int, int&gt;&gt;.

    The resource binding model QRhi assumes is based on SPIR-V. This means that
    uniform buffers, storage buffers, combined image samplers, and storage
    images share a common binding point space. The binding numbers in
    QShaderDescription and QRhiShaderResourceBinding are expected to match the
    \c binding layout qualifier in the Vulkan-compatible GLSL shader.

    Graphics APIs other than Vulkan may use a resource binding model that is
    not fully compatible with this. The generator of the shader code translated
    from SPIR-V may choose not to take the SPIR-V binding qualifiers into
    account, for various reasons. This is the case with the Metal backend of
    SPIRV-Cross, for example. In addition, even when an automatic, implicit
    translation is mostly possible (e.g. by using SPIR-V binding points as HLSL
    resource register indices), assigning resource bindings without being
    constrained by the SPIR-V binding points can lead to better results.

    Therefore, a QShader may expose an additional map that describes what the
    native binding point for a given SPIR-V binding is. The QRhi backends, for
    which this is relevant, are expected to use this map automatically, as
    appropriate. The value is a pair, because combined image samplers may map
    to two native resources (a texture and a sampler) in some shading
    languages. In that case the second value refers to the sampler.

    \note The native binding may be -1, in case there is no active binding for
    the resource in the shader. (for example, there is a uniform block
    declared, but it is not used in the shader code) The map is always
    complete, meaning there is an entry for all declared uniform blocks,
    storage blocks, image objects, and combined samplers, but the value will be
    -1 for those that are not actually referenced in the shader functions.
