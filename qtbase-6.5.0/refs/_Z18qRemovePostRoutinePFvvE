    \relates QCoreApplication
    \since 5.3

    Removes the cleanup routine specified by \a ptr from the list of
    routines called by the QCoreApplication destructor. The routine
    must have been previously added to the list by a call to
    qAddPostRoutine(), otherwise this function has no effect.

    \note This function has been thread-safe since Qt 5.10.
