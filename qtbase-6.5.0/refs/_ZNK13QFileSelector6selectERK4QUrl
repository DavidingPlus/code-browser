   This is a convenience version of select operating on QUrl objects. If the scheme is not file or qrc,
   \a filePath is returned immediately. Otherwise selection is applied to the path of \a filePath
   and a QUrl is returned with the selected path and other QUrl parts the same as \a filePath.

   See the class overview for the selection algorithm.
