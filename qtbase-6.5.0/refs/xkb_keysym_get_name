<doc f='include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h' l='405'>/**
 * Get the name of a keysym.
 *
 * For a description of how keysyms are named, see @ref xkb_keysym_t.
 *
 * @param[in]  keysym The keysym.
 * @param[out] buffer A string buffer to write the name into.
 * @param[in]  size   Size of the buffer.
 *
 * @warning If the buffer passed is too small, the string is truncated
 * (though still NUL-terminated); a size of at least 64 bytes is recommended.
 *
 * @returns The number of bytes in the name, excluding the NUL byte. If
 * the keysym is invalid, returns -1.
 *
 * You may check if truncation has occurred by comparing the return value
 * with the length of buffer, similarly to the snprintf(3) function.
