 * hb_subset_preprocess:
 * @source: a #hb_face_t object.
 *
 * Preprocesses the face and attaches data that will be needed by the
 * subsetter. Future subsetting operations can then use the precomputed data
 * to speed up the subsetting operation.
 *
 * See [subset-preprocessing](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/subset-preprocessing.md)
 * for more information.
 *
 * Note: the preprocessed face may contain sub-blobs that reference the memory
 * backing the source #hb_face_t. Therefore in the case that this memory is not
 * owned by the source face you will need to ensure that memory lives
 * as long as the returned #hb_face_t.
 *
 * Returns: a new #hb_face_t.
 *
 * Since: 6.0.0
