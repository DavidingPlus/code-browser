 * \fn size_t cbor_encoder_get_extra_bytes_needed(const CborEncoder *encoder)
 *
 * Returns how many more bytes the original buffer supplied to
 * cbor_encoder_init() needs to be extended by so that no CborErrorOutOfMemory
 * condition will happen for the encoding. If the buffer was big enough, this
 * function returns 0. The \a encoder must be the original argument as passed
 * to cbor_encoder_init().
 *
 * This function is usually called after an encoding sequence ended with one or
 * more CborErrorOutOfMemory errors, but no other error. If any other error
 * happened, the return value of this function is meaningless.
 *
 * See \ref CborEncoding for an example of using this function.
