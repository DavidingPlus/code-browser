** CAPI3REF: Database Snapshot
** KEYWORDS: {snapshot} {sqlite3_snapshot}
**
** An instance of the snapshot object records the state of a [WAL mode]
** database for some specific point in history.
**
** In [WAL mode], multiple [database connections] that are open on the
** same database file can each be reading a different historical version
** of the database file.  When a [database connection] begins a read
** transaction, that connection sees an unchanging copy of the database
** as it existed for the point in time when the transaction first started.
** Subsequent changes to the database from other connections are not seen
** by the reader until a new read transaction is started.
**
** The sqlite3_snapshot object records state information about an historical
** version of the database file so that it is possible to later open a new read
** transaction that sees that historical version of the database rather than
** the most recent version.
