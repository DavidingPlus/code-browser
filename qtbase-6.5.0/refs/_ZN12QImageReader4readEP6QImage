    \overload

    Reads an image from the device into \a image, which must point to a
    QImage. Returns \c true on success; otherwise, returns \c false.

    If \a image has same format and size as the image data that is about to be
    read, this function may not need to allocate a new image before
    reading. Because of this, it can be faster than the other read() overload,
    which always constructs a new image; especially when reading several
    images with the same format and size.

    \snippet code/src_gui_image_qimagereader.cpp 2

    For image formats that support animation, calling read() repeatedly will
    return the next frame. When all frames have been read, a null image will
    be returned.
