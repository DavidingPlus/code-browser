    \fn QString QObject::tr(const char *sourceText, const char *disambiguation, int n)
    \reentrant

    Returns a translated version of \a sourceText, optionally based on a
    \a disambiguation string and value of \a n for strings containing plurals;
    otherwise returns QString::fromUtf8(\a sourceText) if no appropriate
    translated string is available.

    Example:
    \snippet ../widgets/itemviews/spreadsheet/spreadsheet.cpp implicit tr context
    \dots

    If the same \a sourceText is used in different roles within the
    same context, an additional identifying string may be passed in
    \a disambiguation (\nullptr by default). In Qt 4.4 and earlier, this was
    the preferred way to pass comments to translators.

    Example:

    \snippet code/src_corelib_kernel_qobject.cpp 17
    \dots

    See \l{Writing Source Code for Translation} for a detailed description of
    Qt&apos;s translation mechanisms in general, and the
    \l{Writing Source Code for Translation#Disambiguate Identical Text}
    {Disambiguate Identical Text} section for information on disambiguation.

    \warning This method is reentrant only if all translators are
    installed \e before calling this method. Installing or removing
    translators while performing translations is not supported. Doing
    so will probably result in crashes or other undesirable behavior.
