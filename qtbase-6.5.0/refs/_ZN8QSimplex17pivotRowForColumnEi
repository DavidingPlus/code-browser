  For a given pivot column, find the pivot row. That is, the row with the
  minimum associated &quot;quotient&quot; where:

  - quotient is the division of the value in the last column by the value
    in the pivot column.
  - rows with value less or equal to zero are ignored
  - if two rows have the same quotient, lines are chosen based on the
    highest variable index (value in the first column)

  The last condition avoids a bug where artificial variables would be
  left behind for the second-phase simplex, and with &apos;good&apos;
  constraints would be removed before it, what would lead to incorrect
  results.
