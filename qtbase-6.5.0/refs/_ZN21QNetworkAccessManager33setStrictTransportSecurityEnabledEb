    \since 5.9

    If \a enabled is \c true, QNetworkAccessManager follows the HTTP Strict Transport
    Security policy (HSTS, RFC6797). When processing a request, QNetworkAccessManager
    automatically replaces the &quot;http&quot; scheme with &quot;https&quot; and uses a secure transport
    for HSTS hosts. If it&apos;s set explicitly, port 80 is replaced by port 443.

    When HSTS is enabled, for each HTTP response containing HSTS header and
    received over a secure transport, QNetworkAccessManager will update its HSTS
    cache, either remembering a host with a valid policy or removing a host with
    an expired or disabled HSTS policy.
