 * Performs a basic validation of the CBOR stream pointed by \a it and returns
 * the error it found. If no error was found, it returns CborNoError and the
 * application can iterate over the items with certainty that no other errors
 * will appear during parsing.
 *
 * A basic validation checks for:
 * \list
 *   \li absence of undefined additional information bytes;
 *   \li well-formedness of all numbers, lengths, and simple values;
 *   \li string contents match reported sizes;
 *   \li arrays and maps contain the number of elements they are reported to have;
 * \endlist
 *
 * For further checks, see cbor_value_validate().
 *
 * This function has the same timing and memory requirements as
 * cbor_value_advance().
 *
 * \sa cbor_value_validate(), cbor_value_advance()
