    \property QMenuBar::nativeMenuBar
    \brief Whether or not a menubar will be used as a native menubar on platforms that support it
    \since 4.6

    This property specifies whether or not the menubar should be used as a native menubar on
    platforms that support it. The currently supported platforms are \macos, and
    Linux desktops which use the com.canonical.dbusmenu D-Bus interface (such as Ubuntu Unity).
    If this property is \c true, the menubar is used in the native menubar and is not in the window of
    its parent; if \c false the menubar remains in the window. On other platforms,
    setting this attribute has no effect, and reading this attribute will always return \c false.

    The default is to follow whether the Qt::AA_DontUseNativeMenuBar attribute
    is set for the application. Explicitly setting this property overrides
    the presence (or absence) of the attribute.
