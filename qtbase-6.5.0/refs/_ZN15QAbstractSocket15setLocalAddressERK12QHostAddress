    \since 4.1

    Sets the address on the local side of a connection to
    \a address.

    You can call this function in a subclass of QAbstractSocket to
    change the return value of the localAddress() function after a
    connection has been established. This feature is commonly used by
    proxy connections for virtual connection settings.

    Note that this function does not bind the local address of the socket
    prior to a connection (e.g., QAbstractSocket::bind()).
