  \property QTreeView::uniformRowHeights
  \brief whether all items in the treeview have the same height

  This property should only be set to true if it is guaranteed that all items
  in the view has the same height. This enables the view to do some
  optimizations.

  The height is obtained from the first item in the view.  It is updated
  when the data changes on that item.

  \note If the editor size hint is bigger than the cell size hint, then the
  size hint of the editor will be used.

  By default, this property is \c false.
