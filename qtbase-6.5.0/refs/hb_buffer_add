 * hb_buffer_add:
 * @buffer: An #hb_buffer_t
 * @codepoint: A Unicode code point.
 * @cluster: The cluster value of @codepoint.
 *
 * Appends a character with the Unicode value of @codepoint to @buffer, and
 * gives it the initial cluster value of @cluster. Clusters can be any thing
 * the client wants, they are usually used to refer to the index of the
 * character in the input text stream and are output in
 * #hb_glyph_info_t.cluster field.
 *
 * This function does not check the validity of @codepoint, it is up to the
 * caller to ensure it is a valid Unicode code point.
 *
 * Since: 0.9.7
