    \property QSinglePointEvent::exclusivePointGrabber
    \brief the object that will receive future updates

    The exclusive grabber is an object that has chosen to receive all future
    update events and the release event containing the same point that this
    event carries.

    Setting the exclusivePointGrabber property is a convenience equivalent to:
    \code
    setExclusiveGrabber(points().first(), exclusiveGrabber);
    \endcode
