    This event handler, for event \a event, can be reimplemented in a
    subclass to receive tablet events for the widget.

    If you reimplement this handler, it is very important that you
    \l{QEvent}{ignore()} the event if you do not handle
    it, so that the widget&apos;s parent can interpret it.

    The default implementation ignores the event.

    If tablet tracking is switched off, tablet move events only occur if the
    stylus is in contact with the tablet, or at least one stylus button is
    pressed, while the stylus is being moved. If tablet tracking is switched on,
    tablet move events occur even while the stylus is hovering in proximity of
    the tablet, with no buttons pressed.

    \sa QEvent::ignore(), QEvent::accept(), event(), setTabletTracking(),
    QTabletEvent
