    Returns a MIME type for the given \a fileName and \a device data.

    This overload can be useful when the file is remote, and we started to
    download some of its data in a device. This allows to do full MIME type
    matching for remote files as well.

    If the device is not open, it will be opened by this function, and closed
    after the MIME type detection is completed.

    A valid MIME type is always returned. If \a device data doesn&apos;t match any
    known MIME type data, the default MIME type (application/octet-stream)
    is returned.

    This method looks at both the file name and the file contents,
    if necessary. The file extension has priority over the contents,
    but the contents will be used if the file extension is unknown, or
    matches multiple MIME types.
