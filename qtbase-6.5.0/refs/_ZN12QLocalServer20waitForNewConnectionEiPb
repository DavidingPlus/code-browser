    Waits for at most \a msec milliseconds or until an incoming connection
    is available.  Returns \c true if a connection is available; otherwise
    returns \c false.  If the operation timed out and \a timedOut is not
    \nullptr, *timedOut will be set to true.

    This is a blocking function call. Its use is ill-advised in a
    single-threaded GUI application, since the whole application will stop
    responding until the function returns. waitForNewConnection() is mostly
    useful when there is no event loop available.

    The non-blocking alternative is to connect to the newConnection() signal.

    If msec is -1, this function will not time out.
