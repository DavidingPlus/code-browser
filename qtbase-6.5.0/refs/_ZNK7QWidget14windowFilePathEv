    \property QWidget::windowFilePath
    \since 4.4
    \brief the file path associated with a widget

    This property only makes sense for windows. It associates a file path with
    a window. If you set the file path, but have not set the window title, Qt
    sets the window title to the file name of the specified path, obtained using
    QFileInfo::fileName().

    If the window title is set at any point, then the window title takes precedence and
    will be shown instead of the file path string.

    Additionally, on \macos, this has an added benefit that it sets the
    \l{http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGWindows/chapter_17_section_3.html}{proxy icon}
    for the window, assuming that the file path exists.

    If no file path is set, this property contains an empty string.

    By default, this property contains an empty string.
