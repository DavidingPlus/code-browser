    \since 5.8

    Receives a datagram no larger than \a maxSize bytes and returns it in the
    QNetworkDatagram object, along with the sender&apos;s host address and port. If
    possible, this function will also try to determine the datagram&apos;s
    destination address, port, and the number of hop counts at reception time.

    On failure, returns a QNetworkDatagram that reports \l
    {QNetworkDatagram::isValid()}{not valid}.

    If \a maxSize is too small, the rest of the datagram will be lost. If \a
    maxSize is 0, the datagram will be discarded. If \a maxSize is -1 (the
    default), this function will attempt to read the entire datagram.
