<doc f='include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h' l='1178'>/**
 * Determine whether a key should repeat or not.
 *
 * A keymap may specify different repeat behaviors for different keys.
 * Most keys should generally exhibit repeat behavior; for example, holding
 * the &apos;a&apos; key down in a text editor should normally insert a single &apos;a&apos;
 * character every few milliseconds, until the key is released.  However,
 * there are keys which should not or do not need to be repeated.  For
 * example, repeating modifier keys such as Left/Right Shift or Caps Lock
 * is not generally useful or desired.
 *
 * @returns 1 if the key should repeat, 0 otherwise.
