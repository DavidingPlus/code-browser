        Any whitespace in the pattern string which is not escaped and outside a
        character class is ignored. Moreover, an unescaped sharp (\b{#})
        outside a character class causes all the following characters, until
        the first newline (included), to be ignored. This can be used to
        increase the readability of a pattern string as well as put comments
        inside regular expressions; this is particularly useful if the pattern
        string is loaded from a file or written by the user, because in C++
        code it is always possible to use the rules for string literals to put
        comments outside the pattern string. This option corresponds to the \c{/x}
        modifier in Perl regular expressions.</doc>
