    \property QFileDialog::supportedSchemes
    \brief the URL schemes that the file dialog should allow navigating to.
    \since 5.6

    Setting this property allows to restrict the type of URLs the
    user will be able to select. It is a way for the application to declare
    the protocols it will support to fetch the file content. An empty list
    means that no restriction is applied (the default).
    Supported for local files (&quot;file&quot; scheme) is implicit and always enabled;
    it is not necessary to include it in the restriction.
