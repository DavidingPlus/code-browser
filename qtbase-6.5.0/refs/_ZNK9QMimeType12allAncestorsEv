    \property QMimeType::allAncestors
    \brief the names of direct and indirect parent MIME types

    Return all the parent mimetypes of this mimetype, direct and indirect.
    This includes the parent(s) of its parent(s), etc.

    For instance, for image/svg+xml the list would be:
    application/xml, text/plain, application/octet-stream.

    Note that application/octet-stream is the ultimate parent for all types
    of files (but not directories).

    While this property was introduced in 5.10, the
    corresponding accessor method has always been there.
