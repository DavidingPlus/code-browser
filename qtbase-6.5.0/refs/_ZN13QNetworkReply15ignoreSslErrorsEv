    If this function is called, SSL errors related to network
    connection will be ignored, including certificate validation
    errors.

    \warning Be sure to always let the user inspect the errors
    reported by the sslErrors() signal, and only call this method
    upon confirmation from the user that proceeding is ok.
    If there are unexpected errors, the reply should be aborted.
    Calling this method without inspecting the actual errors will
    most likely pose a security risk for your application. Use it
    with great care!

    This function can be called from the slot connected to the
    sslErrors() signal, which indicates which errors were
    found.

    \note If HTTP Strict Transport Security is enabled for QNetworkAccessManager,
    this function has no effect.
