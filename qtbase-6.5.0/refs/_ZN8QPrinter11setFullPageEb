  If \a fp is true, enables support for painting over the entire page;
  otherwise restricts painting to the printable area reported by the
  device.

  By default, full page printing is disabled. In this case, the origin
  of the QPrinter&apos;s coordinate system coincides with the top-left
  corner of the printable area.

  If full page printing is enabled, the origin of the QPrinter&apos;s
  coordinate system coincides with the top-left corner of the paper
  itself. In this case, the
  \l{QPaintDevice::PaintDeviceMetric}{device metrics} will report
  the exact same dimensions as indicated by \{QPageSize}. It may not
  be possible to print on the entire physical page because of the
  printer&apos;s margins, so the application must account for the margins
  itself.
