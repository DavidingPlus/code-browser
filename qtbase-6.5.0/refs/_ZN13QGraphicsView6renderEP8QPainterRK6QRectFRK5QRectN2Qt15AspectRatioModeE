    Renders the \a source rect, which is in view coordinates, from the scene
    into \a target, which is in paint device coordinates, using \a
    painter. This function is useful for capturing the contents of the view
    onto a paint device, such as a QImage (e.g., to take a screenshot), or for
    printing to QPrinter. For example:

    \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsview.cpp 4

    If \a source is a null rect, this function will use viewport()-&gt;rect() to
    determine what to draw. If \a target is a null rect, the full dimensions
    of \a painter&apos;s paint device (e.g., for a QPrinter, the page size) will be
    used.

    The source rect contents will be transformed according to \a
    aspectRatioMode to fit into the target rect. By default, the aspect ratio
    is kept, and \a source is scaled to fit in \a target.
