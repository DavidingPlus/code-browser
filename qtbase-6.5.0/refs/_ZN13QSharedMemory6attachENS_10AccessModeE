  Attempts to attach the process to the shared memory segment
  identified by the key that was passed to the constructor or to a
  call to setKey() or setNativeKey(). The access \a mode is \l {QSharedMemory::}
  {ReadWrite} by default. It can also be \l {QSharedMemory::}
  {ReadOnly}. Returns \c true if the attach operation is successful. If
  false is returned, call error() to determine which error occurred.
  After attaching the shared memory segment, a pointer to the shared
  memory can be obtained by calling data().
