    \fn bool QWheelEvent::inverted() const
    \since 5.7

    Returns whether the delta values delivered with the event are inverted.

    Normally, a vertical wheel will produce a QWheelEvent with positive delta
    values if the top of the wheel is rotating away from the hand operating it.
    Similarly, a horizontal wheel movement will produce a QWheelEvent with
    positive delta values if the top of the wheel is moved to the left.

    However, on some platforms this is configurable, so that the same
    operations described above will produce negative delta values (but with the
    same magnitude). With the inverted property a wheel event consumer can
    choose to always follow the direction of the wheel, regardless of the
    system settings, but only for specific widgets. (One such use case could be
    that the user is rotating the wheel in the same direction as a visual
    Tumbler rotates. Another usecase is to make a slider handle follow the
    direction of movement of fingers on a touchpad regardless of system
    configuration.)

    \note Many platforms provide no such information. On such platforms
    \l inverted always returns false.
