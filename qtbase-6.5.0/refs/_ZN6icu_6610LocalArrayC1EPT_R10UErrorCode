     * Constructor takes ownership and reports an error if NULL.

     * This constructor is intended to be used with other-class constructors

     * and not also separately for isNull().
     *
     * @param p simple pointer to an array of T objects that is adopted
     * @param errorCode in/out UErrorCode, set to U_MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ERROR
     *     if p==NULL and no other failure code had been set
