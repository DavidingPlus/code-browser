 * g_assert_finalize_object: (skip)
 * @object: (transfer full) (type GObject.Object): an object
 *
 * Assert that @object is non-%NULL, then release one reference to it with
 * g_object_unref() and assert that it has been finalized (i.e. that there
 * are no more references).
 *
 * If assertions are disabled via `G_DISABLE_ASSERT`,
 * this macro just calls g_object_unref() without any further checks.
 *
 * This macro should only be used in regression tests.
