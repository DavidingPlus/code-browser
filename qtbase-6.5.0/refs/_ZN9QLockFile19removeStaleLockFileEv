    Attempts to forcefully remove an existing lock file.

    Calling this is not recommended when protecting a short-lived operation: QLockFile
    already takes care of removing lock files after they are older than staleLockTime().

    This method should only be called when protecting a resource for a long time, i.e.
    with staleLockTime(0), and after tryLock() returned LockFailedError, and the user
    agreed on removing the lock file.

    Returns \c true on success, false if the lock file couldn&apos;t be removed. This happens
    on Windows, when the application owning the lock is still running.
