 * Set a custom function to handle logging messages.
 *
 * @param context The context in which to use the set logging function.
 * @param log_fn  The function that will be called for logging messages.
 * Passing NULL restores the default function, which logs to stderr.
 *
 * By default, log messages from this library are printed to stderr.  This
 * function allows you to replace the default behavior with a custom
 * handler.  The handler is only called with messages which match the
 * current logging level and verbosity settings for the context.
 * level is the logging level of the message.  @a format and @a args are
 * the same as in the vprintf(3) function.
 *
 * You may use xkb_context_set_user_data() on the context, and then call
 * xkb_context_get_user_data() from within the logging function to provide
 * it with additional private context.
