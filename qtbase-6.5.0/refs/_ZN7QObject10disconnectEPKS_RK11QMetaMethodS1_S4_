    Disconnects \a signal in object \a sender from \a method in object
    \a receiver. Returns \c true if the connection is successfully broken;
    otherwise returns \c false.

    This function provides the same possibilities like
    \c {disconnect(const QObject *sender, const char *signal, const QObject *receiver, const char *method) }
    but uses QMetaMethod to represent the signal and the method to be disconnected.

    Additionally this function returns false and no signals and slots disconnected
    if:
    \list 1

        \li \a signal is not a member of sender class or one of its parent classes.

        \li \a method is not a member of receiver class or one of its parent classes.

        \li \a signal instance represents not a signal.

    \endlist

    QMetaMethod() may be used as wildcard in the meaning &quot;any signal&quot; or &quot;any slot in receiving object&quot;.
    In the same way \nullptr can be used for \a receiver in the meaning &quot;any receiving object&quot;.
    In this case method should also be QMetaMethod(). \a sender parameter should be never \nullptr.
