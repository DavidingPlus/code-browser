<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/kernel/qplatformscreen.h' l='142'>// virtualSibling can be passed in to make the placeholder a sibling with other screens during
    // the transitioning phase when the real screen is about to be removed, or the first real screen
    // is about to be added. This is useful because Qt will currently recreate (but now show!)
    // windows when they are moved from one virtual desktop to another, so if the last monitor is
    // unplugged, then plugged in again, windows will be hidden unless the placeholder belongs to
    // the same virtual desktop as the other screens.</doc>
