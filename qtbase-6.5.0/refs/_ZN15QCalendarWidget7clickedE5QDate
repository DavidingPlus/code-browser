    This signal is emitted when a mouse button is clicked. The date
    the mouse was clicked on is specified by \a date. The signal is
    only emitted when clicked on a valid date, e.g., dates are not
    outside the minimumDate() and maximumDate(). If the selection mode
    is NoSelection, this signal will not be emitted.
