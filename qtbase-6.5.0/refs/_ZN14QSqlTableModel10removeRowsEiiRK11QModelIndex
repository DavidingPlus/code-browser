    Removes \a count rows starting at \a row. Since this model
    does not support hierarchical structures, \a parent must be
    an invalid model index.

    When the edit strategy is OnManualSubmit, deletion of rows from
    the database is delayed until submitAll() is called.

    For OnFieldChange and OnRowChange, only one row may be deleted
    at a time and only if no other row has a cached change. Deletions
    are submitted immediately to the database. The model retains a
    blank row for successfully deleted row until refreshed with select().

    After failed deletion, the operation is not reverted in the model.
    The application may resubmit or revert.

    Inserted but not yet successfully submitted rows in the range to be
    removed are immediately removed from the model.

    Before a row is deleted from the database, the beforeDelete()
    signal is emitted.

    If row &lt; 0 or row + count &gt; rowCount(), no action is taken and
    false is returned. Returns \c true if all rows could be removed;
    otherwise returns \c false. Detailed database error information
    can be retrieved using lastError().
