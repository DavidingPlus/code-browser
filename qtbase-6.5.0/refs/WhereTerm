** The query generator uses an array of instances of this structure to
** help it analyze the subexpressions of the WHERE clause.  Each WHERE
** clause subexpression is separated from the others by AND operators,
** usually, or sometimes subexpressions separated by OR.
**
** All WhereTerms are collected into a single WhereClause structure.
** The following identity holds:
**
**        WhereTerm.pWC-&gt;a[WhereTerm.idx] == WhereTerm
**
** When a term is of the form:
**
**              X &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;
**
** where X is a column name and &lt;op&gt; is one of certain operators,
** then WhereTerm.leftCursor and WhereTerm.u.leftColumn record the
** cursor number and column number for X.  WhereTerm.eOperator records
** the &lt;op&gt; using a bitmask encoding defined by WO_xxx below.  The
** use of a bitmask encoding for the operator allows us to search
** quickly for terms that match any of several different operators.
**
** A WhereTerm might also be two or more subterms connected by OR:
**
**         (t1.X &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;) OR (t1.Y &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;) OR ....
**
** In this second case, wtFlag has the TERM_ORINFO bit set and eOperator==WO_OR
** and the WhereTerm.u.pOrInfo field points to auxiliary information that
** is collected about the OR clause.
**
** If a term in the WHERE clause does not match either of the two previous
** categories, then eOperator==0.  The WhereTerm.pExpr field is still set
** to the original subexpression content and wtFlags is set up appropriately
** but no other fields in the WhereTerm object are meaningful.
**
** When eOperator!=0, prereqRight and prereqAll record sets of cursor numbers,
** but they do so indirectly.  A single WhereMaskSet structure translates
** cursor number into bits and the translated bit is stored in the prereq
** fields.  The translation is used in order to maximize the number of
** bits that will fit in a Bitmask.  The VDBE cursor numbers might be
** spread out over the non-negative integers.  For example, the cursor
** numbers might be 3, 8, 9, 10, 20, 23, 41, and 45.  The WhereMaskSet
** translates these sparse cursor numbers into consecutive integers
** beginning with 0 in order to make the best possible use of the available
** bits in the Bitmask.  So, in the example above, the cursor numbers
** would be mapped into integers 0 through 7.
**
** The number of terms in a join is limited by the number of bits
** in prereqRight and prereqAll.  The default is 64 bits, hence SQLite
** is only able to process joins with 64 or fewer tables.
