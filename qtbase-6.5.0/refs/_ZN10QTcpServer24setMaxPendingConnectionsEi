    Sets the maximum number of pending accepted connections to \a
    numConnections. QTcpServer will accept no more than \a
    numConnections incoming connections before
    nextPendingConnection() is called. By default, the limit is 30
    pending connections.

    Clients may still able to connect after the server has reached
    its maximum number of pending connections (i.e., QTcpSocket can
    still emit the connected() signal). QTcpServer will stop
    accepting the new connections, but the operating system may
    still keep them in queue.
