    \typedef QSettings::WriteFunc

    Typedef for a pointer to a function with the following signature:

    \snippet code/src_corelib_io_qsettings.cpp 28

    \c WriteFunc is used in \c registerFormat() as a pointer to a function
    that writes a set of key/value pairs. \c WriteFunc is only called once,
    so you need to output the settings in one go.

    \sa ReadFunc, registerFormat()
