** For each index X that has as one of its arguments either an expression
** or the name of a virtual generated column, and if X is in scope such that
** the value of the expression can simply be read from the index, then
** there is an instance of this object on the Parse.pIdxExpr list.
**
** During code generation, while generating code to evaluate expressions,
** this list is consulted and if a matching expression is found, the value
** is read from the index rather than being recomputed.
