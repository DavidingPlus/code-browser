<doc f='include/unicode/unistr.h' l='1873'>/**
   * Almost the same as the assignment operator.
   * Replace the characters in this UnicodeString
   * with the characters from `srcText`.
   *
   * This function works the same as the assignment operator
   * for all strings except for ones that are readonly aliases.
   *
   * Starting with ICU 2.4, the assignment operator and the copy constructor
   * allocate a new buffer and copy the buffer contents even for readonly aliases.
   * This function implements the old, more efficient but less safe behavior
   * of making this string also a readonly alias to the same buffer.
   *
   * The fastCopyFrom function must be used only if it is known that the lifetime of
   * this UnicodeString does not exceed the lifetime of the aliased buffer
   * including its contents, for example for strings from resource bundles
   * or aliases to string constants.
   *
   * If the source object has an &quot;open&quot; buffer from getBuffer(minCapacity),
   * then the copy is an empty string.
   *
   * @param src The text containing the characters to replace.
   * @return a reference to this
   * @stable ICU 2.4
