    \fn Qt::MouseEventSource QWheelEvent::source() const
    \since 5.5
    \deprecated [6.0] Use pointingDevice() instead.

    Returns information about the wheel event source.

    The source can be used to distinguish between events that come from a mouse
    with a physical wheel and events that are generated by some other means,
    such as a flick gesture on a touchpad.
    This enum tells you from where it was synthesized; but often
    it&apos;s more useful to know from which device it was synthesized,
    so try to use pointingDevice() instead.

    \note Many platforms provide no such information. On such platforms
    \l Qt::MouseEventNotSynthesized is returned always.

    \sa Qt::MouseEventSource
