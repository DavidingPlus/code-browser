    \since 4.5

    Returns \c true if this IP is in the subnet described by the network
    prefix \a subnet and netmask \a netmask.

    An IP is considered to belong to a subnet if it is contained
    between the lowest and the highest address in that subnet. In the
    case of IP version 4, the lowest address is the network address,
    while the highest address is the broadcast address.

    The \a subnet argument does not have to be the actual network
    address (the lowest address in the subnet). It can be any valid IP
    belonging to that subnet. In particular, if it is equal to the IP
    address held by this object, this function will always return true
    (provided the netmask is a valid value).
