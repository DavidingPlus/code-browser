    Records an indexed draw.

    The number of vertices is specified in \a indexCount. \a firstIndex is the
    base index. The effective offset in the index buffer is given by
    \c{indexOffset + firstIndex * n} where \c n is 2 or 4 depending on the
    index element type. \c indexOffset is specified in setVertexInput().

    \note The effective offset in the index buffer must be 4 byte aligned with
    some backends (for example, Metal). With these backends the
    \l{QRhi::NonFourAlignedEffectiveIndexBufferOffset}{NonFourAlignedEffectiveIndexBufferOffset}
    feature will be reported as not-supported.

    For instanced drawing set \a instanceCount to a value other than 1. When
    drawing multiple instances, the first instance ID is specified by \a
    firstInstance.

    \note \a firstInstance may not be supported, and is ignored when the
    QRhi::BaseInstance feature is reported as not supported. The first ID is
    always 0 in that case.

    \a vertexOffset (also called \c{base vertex}) is a signed value that is
    added to the element index before indexing into the vertex buffer. Support
    for this is not always available, and the value is ignored when the feature
    QRhi::BaseVertex is reported as unsupported.

    \note This function can only be called inside a render pass, meaning
    between a beginPass() and endPass() call.
