    Sets the sender address associated with this datagram to be the address \a
    address and port number \a port. The sender address and port numbers are
    usually set by \l QUdpSocket upon reception, so there&apos;s no need to call
    this function on a received datagram.

    For outgoing datagrams, this function can be used to set the address the
    datagram should carry. The address \a address must usually be one of the
    local addresses assigned to this machine, which can be obtained using \l
    QNetworkInterface. If left unset, the operating system will choose the most
    appropriate address to use given the destination in question.

    The port number \a port must be the port number associated with the socket,
    if there is one. The value of 0 can be used to indicate that the operating
    system should choose the port number.
