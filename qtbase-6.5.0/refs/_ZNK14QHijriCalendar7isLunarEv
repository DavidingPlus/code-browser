    \brief The QHijriCalendar class supports Islamic (Hijri) calendar implementations.

    \section1 Islamic Calendar System

    The Islamic, Muslim, or Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar consisting of 12
    months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used (often alongside the
    Gregorian calendar) to date events in many Muslim countries. It is also used
    by Muslims to determine the proper days of Islamic holidays and rituals,
    such as the annual period of fasting and the proper time for the pilgrimage
    to Mecca.

    \section1 Support for variants

    This base class provides the common details shared by all variants on the
    Islamic calendar. Each year comprises 12 months of 29 or 30 days each; most
    years have as many of 29 as of 30, but leap years extend one 29-day month to
    30 days. In tabular versions of the calendar (where mathematical rules are
    used to determine the details), odd-numbered months have 30 days, as does
    the last (twelfth) month of a leap year; all other months have 29
    days. Other versions are based on actual astronomical observations of the
    moon&apos;s phase at sunset, which vary from place to place.
