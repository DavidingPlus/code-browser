    \property QGraphicsView::cacheMode
    \brief which parts of the view are cached

    QGraphicsView can cache pre-rendered content in a QPixmap, which is then
    drawn onto the viewport. The purpose of such caching is to speed up the
    total rendering time for areas that are slow to render.  Texture, gradient
    and alpha blended backgrounds, for example, can be notibly slow to render;
    especially with a transformed view. The CacheBackground flag enables
    caching of the view&apos;s background. For example:

    \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsview.cpp 2

    The cache is invalidated every time the view is transformed. However, when
    scrolling, only partial invalidation is required.

    By default, nothing is cached.
