    Adds a mapping between a \a widget and a \a section from the model.
    The \a section is a column in the model if the orientation is
    horizontal (the default), otherwise a row.

    For the following example, we assume a model \c myModel that
    has two columns: the first one contains the names of people in a
    group, and the second column contains their ages. The first column
    is mapped to the QLineEdit \c nameLineEdit, and the second is
    mapped to the QSpinBox \c{ageSpinBox}:

    \b{Notes:}
    \list
    \li If the \a widget is already mapped to a section, the
    old mapping will be replaced by the new one.
    \li Only one-to-one mappings between sections and widgets are allowed.
    It is not possible to map a single section to multiple widgets, or to
    map a single widget to multiple sections.
