 * g_clear_weak_pointer: (skip)
 * @weak_pointer_location: The memory address of a pointer
 *
 * Clears a weak reference to a #GObject.
 *
 * @weak_pointer_location must not be %NULL.
 *
 * If the weak reference is %NULL then this function does nothing.
 * Otherwise, the weak reference to the object is removed for that location
 * and the pointer is set to %NULL.
 *
 * A macro is also included that allows this function to be used without
 * pointer casts. The function itself is static inline, so its address may vary
 * between compilation units.

 * Since: 2.56
