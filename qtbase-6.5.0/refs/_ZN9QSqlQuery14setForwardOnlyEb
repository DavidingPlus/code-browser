  Sets forward only mode to \a forward. If \a forward is true, only
  next() and seek() with positive values, are allowed for navigating
  the results.

  Forward only mode can be (depending on the driver) more memory
  efficient since results do not need to be cached. It will also
  improve performance on some databases. For this to be true, you must
  call \c setForwardOnly() before the query is prepared or executed.
  Note that the constructor that takes a query and a database may
  execute the query.

  Forward only mode is off by default.

  Setting forward only to false is a suggestion to the database engine,
  which has the final say on whether a result set is forward only or
  scrollable. isForwardOnly() will always return the correct status of
  the result set.

  \note Calling setForwardOnly after execution of the query will result
  in unexpected results at best, and crashes at worst.

  \note To make sure the forward-only query completed successfully,
  the application should check lastError() for an error not only after
  executing the query, but also after navigating the query results.

  \warning PostgreSQL: While navigating the query results in forward-only
  mode, do not execute any other SQL command on the same database
  connection. This will cause the query results to be lost.
