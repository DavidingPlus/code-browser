    Sets the proxy to be used in future requests to be \a proxy. This
    does not affect requests that have already been sent. The
    proxyAuthenticationRequired() signal will be emitted if the proxy
    requests authentication.

    A proxy set with this function will be used for all requests
    issued by QNetworkAccessManager. In some cases, it might be
    necessary to select different proxies depending on the type of
    request being sent or the destination host. If that&apos;s the case,
    you should consider using setProxyFactory().
