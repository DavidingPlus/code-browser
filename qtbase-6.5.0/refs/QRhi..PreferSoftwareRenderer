<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='422'>\value PreferSoftwareRenderer Indicates that backends should prefer
    choosing an adapter or physical device that renders in software on the CPU.
    For example, with Direct3D there is typically a &quot;Basic Render Driver&quot;
    adapter available with \c{DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_SOFTWARE}. Setting this flag
    requests the backend to choose that adapter over any other, as long as no
    specific adapter was forced by other backend-specific means. With Vulkan
    this maps to preferring physical devices with
    \c{VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU}. When not available, or when it is not
    possible to decide if an adapter/device is software-based, this flag is
    ignored. It may also be ignored with graphics APIs that have no concept and
    means of enumerating adapters/devices.</doc>
