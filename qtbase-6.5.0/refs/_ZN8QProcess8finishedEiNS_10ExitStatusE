    \fn void QProcess::finished(int exitCode, QProcess::ExitStatus exitStatus)

    This signal is emitted when the process finishes. \a exitCode is the exit
    code of the process (only valid for normal exits), and \a exitStatus is
    the exit status.
    After the process has finished, the buffers in QProcess are still intact.
    You can still read any data that the process may have written before it
    finished.

    \sa exitStatus()
