** CAPI3REF: Read Data From A BLOB Incrementally
** METHOD: sqlite3_blob
**
** ^(This function is used to read data from an open [BLOB handle] into a
** caller-supplied buffer. N bytes of data are copied into buffer Z
** from the open BLOB, starting at offset iOffset.)^
**
** ^If offset iOffset is less than N bytes from the end of the BLOB,
** [SQLITE_ERROR] is returned and no data is read.  ^If N or iOffset is
** less than zero, [SQLITE_ERROR] is returned and no data is read.
** ^The size of the blob (and hence the maximum value of N+iOffset)
** can be determined using the [sqlite3_blob_bytes()] interface.
**
** ^An attempt to read from an expired [BLOB handle] fails with an
** error code of [SQLITE_ABORT].
**
** ^(On success, sqlite3_blob_read() returns SQLITE_OK.
** Otherwise, an [error code] or an [extended error code] is returned.)^
**
** This routine only works on a [BLOB handle] which has been created
** by a prior successful call to [sqlite3_blob_open()] and which has not
** been closed by [sqlite3_blob_close()].  Passing any other pointer in
** to this routine results in undefined and probably undesirable behavior.
**
** See also: [sqlite3_blob_write()].
