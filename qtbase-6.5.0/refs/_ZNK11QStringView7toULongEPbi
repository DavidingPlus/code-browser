    \fn ulong QStringView::toULong(bool *ok, int base) const

    Returns the string view converted to an \c{unsigned long} using base \a
    base, which is 10 by default and must be between 2 and 36, or 0.
    Returns 0 if the conversion fails.

    If \a ok is not \nullptr, failure is reported by setting *\a{ok}
    to \c false, and success by setting *\a{ok} to \c true.

    If \a base is 0, the C language convention is used: if the string view
    begins with &quot;0x&quot;, base 16 is used; otherwise, if the string view begins with &quot;0&quot;,
    base 8 is used; otherwise, base 10 is used.

    The string conversion will always happen in the &apos;C&apos; locale. For locale
    dependent conversion use QLocale::toULongLong()
