    \property QGraphicsScene::minimumRenderSize
    \since 5.4
    \brief the minimal view-transformed size an item must have to be drawn

    When the scene is rendered, any item whose width or height, transformed
    to the target view, is smaller that minimumRenderSize(), will not be
    rendered. If an item is not rendered and it clips its children items
    they will also not be rendered. Set this value to speed up rendering
    of scenes with many objects rendered on a zoomed out view.

    The default value is 0. If unset, or if set to 0 or a negative value,
    all items will always be rendered.

    For example, setting this property can be especially useful if a scene
    is rendered by multiple views, one of which serves as an overview which
    always displays all items. In scenes with many items, such a view will
    use a high scaling factor so that all items can be shown. Due to the
    scaling, smaller items will only make an insignificant contribution to
    the final rendered scene. To avoid drawing these items and reduce the
    time necessary to render the scene, you can call setMinimumRenderSize()
    with a non-negative value.

    \note Items that are not drawn as a result of being too small, are still
    returned by methods such as items() and itemAt(), and participate in
    collision detection and interactions. It is recommended that you set
    minimumRenderSize() to a value less than or equal to 1 in order to
    avoid large unrendered items that are interactive.
