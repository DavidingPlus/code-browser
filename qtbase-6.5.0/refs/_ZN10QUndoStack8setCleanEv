    Marks the stack as clean and emits cleanChanged() if the stack was
    not already clean.

    This is typically called when a document is saved, for example.

    Whenever the stack returns to this state through the use of undo/redo
    commands, it emits the signal cleanChanged(). This signal is also
    emitted when the stack leaves the clean state.
