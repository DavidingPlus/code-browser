** During code generation of statements that do inserts into AUTOINCREMENT
** tables, the following information is attached to the Table.u.autoInc.p
** pointer of each autoincrement table to record some side information that
** the code generator needs.  We have to keep per-table autoincrement
** information in case inserts are done within triggers.  Triggers do not
** normally coordinate their activities, but we do need to coordinate the
** loading and saving of autoincrement information.
