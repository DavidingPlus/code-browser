    \internal
    Finds the device instance belonging to the drawing or eraser end of a particular stylus,
    identified by its \a deviceType, \a pointerType, \a uniqueId and \a systemId.
    Returns the device found, or \c nullptr if none was found.

    If \a systemId is \c 0, it&apos;s not significant for the search.

    If an instance matching the given \a deviceType and \a pointerType but with
    only a default-constructed \c uniqueId is found, it will be assumed to be
    the one we&apos;re looking for, its \c uniqueId will be updated to match the
    given \a uniqueId, and its \c capabilities will be updated to match the
    given \a capabilities. This is for the benefit of any platform plugin that can
    discover the tablet itself at startup, along with the supported stylus types,
    but then discovers specific styli later on as they come into proximity.
