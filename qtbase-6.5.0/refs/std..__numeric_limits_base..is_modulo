<doc f='include/c++/9/limits' l='281'>/** True if the type is @e modulo. A type is modulo if, for any
	operation involving +, -, or * on values of that type whose
	result would fall outside the range [min(),max()], the value
	returned differs from the true value by an integer multiple of
	max() - min() + 1. On most machines, this is false for floating
	types, true for unsigned integers, and true for signed integers.
