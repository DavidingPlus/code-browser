   * Field number 
   * indicating the modified Julian day number.  This is different from
   * the conventional Julian day number in two regards.  First, it
   * demarcates days at local zone midnight, rather than noon GMT.
   * Second, it is a local number; that is, it depends on the local time
   * zone.  It can be thought of as a single number that encompasses all
   * the date-related fields.
