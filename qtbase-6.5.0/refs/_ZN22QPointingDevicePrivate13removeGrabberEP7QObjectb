    \internal
    Removes the given \a grabber as both passive and exclusive grabber from all
    points in activePoints where it&apos;s currently found. If \a cancel is \c true,
    the transition emitted from the grabChanged() signal will be
    \c CancelGrabExclusive or \c CancelGrabPassive. Otherwise it will be
    \c UngrabExclusive or \c UngrabPassive.

    \note This function provides a way to work around the limitation that we
    normally change grabbers only during event delivery; but it&apos;s also more expensive.
