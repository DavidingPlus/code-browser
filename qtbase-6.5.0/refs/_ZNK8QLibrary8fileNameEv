    \property QLibrary::fileName
    \brief the file name of the library

    We recommend omitting the file&apos;s suffix in the file name, since
    QLibrary will automatically look for the file with the appropriate
    suffix (see isLibrary()).

    When loading the library, QLibrary searches in all system-specific
    library locations (for example, \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix), unless the
    file name has an absolute path. After loading the library
    successfully, fileName() returns the fully-qualified file name of
    the library, including the full path to the library if one was given
    in the constructor or passed to setFileName().

    For example, after successfully loading the &quot;GL&quot; library on Unix
    platforms, fileName() will return &quot;libGL.so&quot;. If the file name was
    originally passed as &quot;/usr/lib/libGL&quot;, fileName() will return
    &quot;/usr/lib/libGL.so&quot;.
