    Waits for any work on the graphics queue (where applicable) to complete,
    then executes all deferred operations, like completing readbacks and
    resource releases. Can be called inside and outside of a frame, but not
    inside a pass. Inside a frame it implies submitting any work on the
    command buffer.

    \note Avoid this function. One case where it may be needed is when the
    results of an enqueued readback in a swapchain-based frame are needed at a
    fixed given point and so waiting for the results is desired.
