    Returns the clean index. This is the index at which setClean() was called.

    A stack may not have a clean index. This happens if a document is saved,
    some commands are undone, then a new command is pushed. Since
    push() deletes all the undone commands before pushing the new command, the stack
    can&apos;t return to the clean state again. In this case, this function returns -1.
    The -1 may also be returned after an explicit call to resetClean().
