    \since 4.7
    Returns the horizontal advance of the text. The advance of the text
    is the distance from its position to the next position at which
    text would naturally be drawn.

    By adding the advance to the position of the text line and using this
    as the position of a second text line, you will be able to position
    the two lines side-by-side without gaps in-between.
