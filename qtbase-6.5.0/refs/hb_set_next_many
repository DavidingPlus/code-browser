 * hb_set_next_many:
 * @set: A set
 * @codepoint: Outputting codepoints starting after this one.
 *             Use #HB_SET_VALUE_INVALID to get started.
 * @out: (array length=size): An array of codepoints to write to.
 * @size: The maximum number of codepoints to write out.
 *
 * Finds the next element in @set that is greater than @codepoint. Writes out
 * codepoints to @out, until either the set runs out of elements, or @size
 * codepoints are written, whichever comes first.
 *
 * Return value: the number of values written.
 *
 * Since: 4.2.0
