** Information about each column of an SQL table is held in an instance
** of the Column structure, in the Table.aCol[] array.
**
** Definitions:
**
**   &quot;table column index&quot;     This is the index of the column in the
**                            Table.aCol[] array, and also the index of
**                            the column in the original CREATE TABLE stmt.
**
**   &quot;storage column index&quot;   This is the index of the column in the
**                            record BLOB generated by the OP_MakeRecord
**                            opcode.  The storage column index is less than
**                            or equal to the table column index.  It is
**                            equal if and only if there are no VIRTUAL
**                            columns to the left.
**
** Notes on zCnName:
** The zCnName field stores the name of the column, the datatype of the
** column, and the collating sequence for the column, in that order, all in
** a single allocation.  Each string is 0x00 terminated.  The datatype
** is only included if the COLFLAG_HASTYPE bit of colFlags is set and the
** collating sequence name is only included if the COLFLAG_HASCOLL bit is
** set.
