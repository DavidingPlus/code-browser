    \brief Take control of how logging categories are configured.

    Installs a function \a filter that is used to determine which categories and
    message types should be enabled. If \a filter is \nullptr, the default
    message filter is reinstated. Returns a pointer to the previously-installed
    filter.

    Every QLoggingCategory object that already exists is passed to the filter
    before \c installFilter() returns, and the filter is free to change each
    category&apos;s configuration with \l setEnabled(). Any category it doesn&apos;t
    change will retain the configuration it was given by the prior filter, so
    the new filter does not need to delegate to the prior filter during this
    initial pass over existing categories.

    Any new categories added later will be passed to the new filter; a filter
    that only aims to tweak the configuration of a select few categories, rather
    than completely overriding the logging policy, can first pass the new
    category to the prior filter, to give it its standard configuration, and
    then tweak that as desired, if it is one of the categories of specific
    interest to the filter. The code that installs the new filter can record the
    return from \c installFilter() for the filter to use in such later calls.

    When you define your filter, note that it can be called from different threads; but never
    concurrently. This filter cannot call any static functions from QLoggingCategory.

    Example:
    \snippet qloggingcategory/main.cpp 21

    installed (in \c{main()}, for example) by

    \snippet qloggingcategory/main.cpp 22

    Alternatively, you can configure the default filter via \l setFilterRules().
