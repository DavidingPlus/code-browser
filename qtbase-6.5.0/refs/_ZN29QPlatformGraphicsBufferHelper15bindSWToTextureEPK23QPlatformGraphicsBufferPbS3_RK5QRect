    Convenience function that uploads the current raster content to the currently
    bound texture.

    \a swizzleRandB is meant to be used by the caller to decide if the Red and
    Blue color channels need to be swizzled when rendering. This is an
    optimization. Qt often renders to software buffers interpreting pixels as
    unsigned ints. When these buffers are uploaded to textures and each color
    channel per pixel is interpreted as a byte (read sequentially), then the
    Red and Blue channels are swapped. Conveniently, the Alpha buffer will be
    correct, since Qt historically has had the alpha channel as the first
    channel, while OpenGL typically expects the alpha channel to be the last
    channel.

    \a subRect is the region to be bound to the texture. This argument has a
    not less than semantic, meaning more (if not all) of the buffer can be
    bound to the texture. An empty QRect is interpreted as meaning the entire
    buffer should be bound.

    This function fails if the \a graphicsBuffer is not locked to SWAccess.

    Returns true on success, otherwise false. If \a premultipliedB is
    provided, it is set according to what happens, if the function returns
    true.
