    \brief the thread priority for new worker threads.

    The value of the property is only used when the thread pool starts
    new threads. Changing it has no effect for already running threads.

    The default value is QThread::InheritPriority, which makes QThread
    use the same priority as the one the QThreadPool object lives in.
