    \property QGraphicsRotation::axis
    \brief a rotation axis, specified by a vector in 3D space.

    This can be any axis in 3D space. By default the axis is (0, 0, 1),
    which is aligned with the Z axis. If you provide another axis,
    QGraphicsRotation will provide a transformation that rotates
    around this axis. For example, if you would like to rotate an item
    around its X axis, you could pass (1, 0, 0) as the axis.
