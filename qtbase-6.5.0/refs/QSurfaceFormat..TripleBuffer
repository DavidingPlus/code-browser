<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/kernel/qsurfaceformat.cpp' l='139'>\value TripleBuffer This swap behaviour is sometimes used in order to decrease the
        risk of skipping a frame when the rendering rate is just barely keeping up with
        the screen refresh rate. Depending on the platform it might also lead to slightly
        more efficient use of the GPU due to improved pipelining behaviour. Triple buffering
        comes at the cost of an extra frame of memory usage and latency, and might not be
        supported depending on the underlying platform.</doc>
