    \since 4.7

    Draws the given \a staticText at the given \a topLeftPosition.

    The text will be drawn using the font and the transformation set on the painter. If the
    font and/or transformation set on the painter are different from the ones used to initialize
    the layout of the QStaticText, then the layout will have to be recalculated. Use
    QStaticText::prepare() to initialize \a staticText with the font and transformation with which
    it will later be drawn.

    If \a topLeftPosition is not the same as when \a staticText was initialized, or when it was
    last drawn, then there will be a slight overhead when translating the text to its new position.

    \note If the painter&apos;s transformation is not affine, then \a staticText will be drawn using
    regular calls to drawText(), losing any potential for performance improvement.

    \note The y-position is used as the top of the font.
