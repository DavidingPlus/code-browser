<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='2240'>\value Immutable Indicates that the data is not expected to change ever
    after the initial upload. Under the hood such buffer resources are
    typically placed in device local (GPU) memory (on systems where
    applicable). Uploading new data is possible, but may be expensive. The
    upload typically happens by copying to a separate, host visible staging
    buffer from which a GPU buffer-to-buffer copy is issued into the actual
    GPU-only buffer.</doc>
