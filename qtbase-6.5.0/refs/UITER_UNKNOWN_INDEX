     * Constant value that may be returned by UCharIteratorMove
     * indicating that the final UTF-16 index is not known, but that the move succeeded.
     * This can occur when moving relative to limit or length, or
     * when moving relative to the current index after a setState()
     * when the current UTF-16 index is not known.
     *
     * It would be very inefficient to have to count from the beginning of the text
     * just to get the current/limit/length index after moving relative to it.
     * The actual index can be determined with getIndex(UITER_CURRENT)
     * which will count the UChars if necessary.
