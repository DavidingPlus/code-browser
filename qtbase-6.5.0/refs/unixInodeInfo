** An instance of the following structure is allocated for each open
** inode.
**
** A single inode can have multiple file descriptors, so each unixFile
** structure contains a pointer to an instance of this object and this
** object keeps a count of the number of unixFile pointing to it.
**
** Mutex rules:
**
**  (1) Only the pLockMutex mutex must be held in order to read or write
**      any of the locking fields:
**          nShared, nLock, eFileLock, bProcessLock, pUnused
**
**  (2) When nRef&gt;0, then the following fields are unchanging and can
**      be read (but not written) without holding any mutex:
**          fileId, pLockMutex
**
**  (3) With the exceptions above, all the fields may only be read
**      or written while holding the global unixBigLock mutex.
**
** Deadlock prevention:  The global unixBigLock mutex may not
** be acquired while holding the pLockMutex mutex.  If both unixBigLock
** and pLockMutex are needed, then unixBigLock must be acquired first.
