    Returns the current clip path in logical coordinates.

    \warning QPainter does not store the combined clip explicitly as
    this is handled by the underlying QPaintEngine, so the path is
    recreated on demand and transformed to the current logical
    coordinate system. This is potentially an expensive operation.
