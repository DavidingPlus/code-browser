** Each cache entry is represented by an instance of the following
** structure. A buffer of PgHdr1.pCache-&gt;szPage bytes is allocated
** directly before this structure and is used to cache the page content.
**
** When reading a corrupt database file, it is possible that SQLite might
** read a few bytes (no more than 16 bytes) past the end of the page buffer.
** It will only read past the end of the page buffer, never write.  This
** object is positioned immediately after the page buffer to serve as an
** overrun area, so that overreads are harmless.
**
** Variables isBulkLocal and isAnchor were once type &quot;u8&quot;. That works,
** but causes a 2-byte gap in the structure for most architectures (since
** pointers must be either 4 or 8-byte aligned). As this structure is located
** in memory directly after the associated page data, if the database is
** corrupt, code at the b-tree layer may overread the page buffer and
** read part of this structure before the corruption is detected. This
** can cause a valgrind error if the unitialized gap is accessed. Using u16
** ensures there is no such gap, and therefore no bytes of uninitialized
** memory in the structure.
**
** The pLruNext and pLruPrev pointers form a double-linked circular list
** of all pages that are unpinned.  The PGroup.lru element (which should be
** the only element on the list with PgHdr1.isAnchor set to 1) forms the
** beginning and the end of the list.
