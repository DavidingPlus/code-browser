** An instance of this object stores information about each a single database

** is derived from the raw on-disk page content.
**
** As each database page is loaded into memory, the pager allocats an
** instance of this object and zeros the first 8 bytes.  (This is the
** &quot;extra&quot; information associated with each page of the pager.)

** Access to all fields of this structure is controlled by the mutex
