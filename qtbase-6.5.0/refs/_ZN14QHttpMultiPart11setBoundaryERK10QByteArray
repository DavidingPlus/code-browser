    Sets the boundary to \a boundary.

    Usually, you do not need to generate a boundary yourself; upon construction
    the boundary is initiated with the string &quot;boundary_.oOo._&quot; followed by random
    characters, and provides enough uniqueness to make sure it does not occur
    inside the parts itself.
