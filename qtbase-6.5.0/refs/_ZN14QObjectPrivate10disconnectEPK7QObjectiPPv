 \internal
 Used by QML to disconnect a signal by index that&apos;s connected to a slot implemented in JavaScript (wrapped in a custom QSlotObjectBase subclass)
 In the QML case the slot is not a pointer to a pointer to the function to disconnect, but instead it is a pointer to an array of internal values
 required for the disconnect.

 This version of disconnect assumes that sender and receiver are the same object.
