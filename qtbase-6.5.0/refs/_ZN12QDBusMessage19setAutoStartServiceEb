    Sets the auto start flag to \a enable. This flag only makes sense
    for method call messages, where it tells the D-Bus server to
    either auto start the service responsible for the service name, or
    not to auto start it.

    By default this flag is true, i.e. a service is autostarted.
    This means:

    When the service that this method call is sent to is already
    running, the method call is sent to it. If the service is not
    running yet, the D-Bus daemon is requested to autostart the
    service that is assigned to this service name. This is
    handled by .service files that are placed in a directory known
    to the D-Bus server. These files then each contain a service
    name and the path to a program that should be executed when
    this service name is requested.
