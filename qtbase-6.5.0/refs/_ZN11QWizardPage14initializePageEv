    This virtual function is called by QWizard::initializePage() to
    prepare the page just before it is shown either as a result of QWizard::restart()
    being called, or as a result of the user clicking \uicontrol Next.
    (However, if the \l QWizard::IndependentPages option is set, this function is only
    called the first time the page is shown.)

    By reimplementing this function, you can ensure that the page&apos;s
    fields are properly initialized based on fields from previous
    pages. For example:

    \snippet dialogs/classwizard/classwizard.cpp 17

    The default implementation does nothing.

    \sa QWizard::initializePage(), cleanupPage(), QWizard::IndependentPages
