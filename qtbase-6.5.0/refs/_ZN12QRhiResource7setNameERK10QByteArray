    Sets a \a name for the object.

    This has two uses: to get descriptive names for the native graphics
    resources visible in graphics debugging tools, such as
    \l{https://renderdoc.org/}{RenderDoc} and
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/xcode/}{XCode}.

    When it comes to naming native objects by relaying the name via the
    appropriate graphics API, note that the name is ignored when
    QRhi::DebugMarkers are not supported, and may, depending on the backend,
    also be ignored when QRhi::EnableDebugMarkers is not set.

    \note The name may be ignored for objects other than buffers,
    renderbuffers, and textures, depending on the backend.

    \note The name may be modified. For slotted resources, such as a QRhiBuffer
    backed by multiple native buffers, QRhi will append a suffix to make the
    underlying native buffers easily distinguishable from each other.
