** CAPI3REF: Enable Or Disable Extension Loading
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** ^So as not to open security holes in older applications that are
** unprepared to deal with [extension loading], and as a means of disabling
** [extension loading] while evaluating user-entered SQL, the following API
** is provided to turn the [sqlite3_load_extension()] mechanism on and off.
**
** ^Extension loading is off by default.
** ^Call the sqlite3_enable_load_extension() routine with onoff==1
** to turn extension loading on and call it with onoff==0 to turn
** it back off again.
**
** ^This interface enables or disables both the C-API
** [sqlite3_load_extension()] and the SQL function [load_extension()].
** ^(Use [sqlite3_db_config](db,[SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION],..)
** to enable or disable only the C-API.)^
**
** &lt;b&gt;Security warning:&lt;/b&gt; It is recommended that extension loading
** be enabled using the [SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION] method
** rather than this interface, so the [load_extension()] SQL function
** remains disabled. This will prevent SQL injections from giving attackers
** access to extension loading capabilities.
