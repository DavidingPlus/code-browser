   * @enum:
   *   FT_Orientation
   *
   * @description:
   *   A list of values used to describe an outline&apos;s contour orientation.
   *
   *   The TrueType and PostScript specifications use different conventions
   *   to determine whether outline contours should be filled or unfilled.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_ORIENTATION_TRUETYPE ::
   *     According to the TrueType specification, clockwise contours must be
   *     filled, and counter-clockwise ones must be unfilled.
   *
   *   FT_ORIENTATION_POSTSCRIPT ::
   *     According to the PostScript specification, counter-clockwise
   *     contours must be filled, and clockwise ones must be unfilled.
   *
   *   FT_ORIENTATION_FILL_RIGHT ::
   *     This is identical to @FT_ORIENTATION_TRUETYPE, but is used to
   *     remember that in TrueType, everything that is to the right of the
   *     drawing direction of a contour must be filled.
   *
   *   FT_ORIENTATION_FILL_LEFT ::
   *     This is identical to @FT_ORIENTATION_POSTSCRIPT, but is used to
   *     remember that in PostScript, everything that is to the left of the
   *     drawing direction of a contour must be filled.
   *
   *   FT_ORIENTATION_NONE ::
   *     The orientation cannot be determined.  That is, different parts of
   *     the glyph have different orientation.
