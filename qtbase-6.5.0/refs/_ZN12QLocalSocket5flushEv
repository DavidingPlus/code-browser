    \fn bool QLocalSocket::flush()

    This function writes as much as possible from the internal write buffer
    to the socket, without blocking.  If any data was written, this function
    returns \c true; otherwise false is returned.

    Call this function if you need QLocalSocket to start sending buffered data
    immediately. The number of bytes successfully written depends on the
    operating system. In most cases, you do not need to call this function,
    because QLocalSocket will start sending data automatically once control
    goes back to the event loop. In the absence of an event loop, call
    waitForBytesWritten() instead.

    \sa write(), waitForBytesWritten()
