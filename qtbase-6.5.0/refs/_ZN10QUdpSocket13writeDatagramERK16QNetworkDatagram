    \since 5.8
    \overload

    Sends the datagram \a datagram to the host address and port numbers
    contained in \a datagram, using the network interface and hop count limits
    also set there. If the destination address and port numbers are unset, this
    function will send to the address that was passed to connectToHost().

    If the destination address is IPv6 with a non-empty
    \l{QHostAddress::scopeId()}{scope id} but differs from the interface index
    in \a datagram, it is undefined which interface the operating system will
    choose to send on.

    The function returns the number of bytes sent if it succeeded or -1 if it
    encountered an error.

    \warning Calling this function on a connected UDP socket may
    result in an error and no packet being sent. If you are using a
    connected socket, use write() to send datagrams.
