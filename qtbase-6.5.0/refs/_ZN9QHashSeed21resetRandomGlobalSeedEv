    \threadsafe

    Reseeds the Qt hashing seed to a new, random value. Calling this function
    is not necessary, but long-running applications may want to do so after a
    long period of time in which information about its hash may have been
    exposed to potential attackers.

    If the environment variable \c QT_HASH_SEED is set to zero, calling this
    function will result in a no-op.

    Qt never calls this function during the execution of the application, but
    unless the \c QT_HASH_SEED variable is set to 0, the hash seed returned by
    globalSeed() will be a random value as if this function had been called.
