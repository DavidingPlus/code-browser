    Schedules the write channel of QProcess to be closed. The channel
    will close once all data has been written to the process. After
    calling this function, any attempts to write to the process will
    fail.

    Closing the write channel is necessary for programs that read
    input data until the channel has been closed. For example, the
    program &quot;more&quot; is used to display text data in a console on both
    Unix and Windows. But it will not display the text data until
    QProcess&apos;s write channel has been closed. Example:

    \snippet code/src_corelib_io_qprocess.cpp 1

    The write channel is implicitly opened when start() is called.

    \sa closeReadChannel()
