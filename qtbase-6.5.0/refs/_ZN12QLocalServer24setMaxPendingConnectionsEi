    Sets the maximum number of pending accepted connections to
    \a numConnections.  QLocalServer will accept no more than
    \a numConnections incoming connections before nextPendingConnection()
    is called.

    Note: Even though QLocalServer will stop accepting new connections
    after it has reached its maximum number of pending connections,
    the operating system may still keep them in queue which will result
    in clients signaling that it is connected.
