    Requests a second session management phase for the application. The
    application may then return immediately from the
    QGuiApplication::commitDataRequest() or QApplication::saveStateRequest()
    function, and they will be called again once most or all other
    applications have finished their session management.

    The two phases are useful for applications such as the X11 window manager
    that need to store information about another application&apos;s windows and
    therefore have to wait until these applications have completed their
    respective session management tasks.

    \note If another application has requested a second phase it may get called
    before, simultaneously with, or after your application&apos;s second phase.
