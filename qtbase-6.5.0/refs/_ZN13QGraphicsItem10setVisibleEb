    If \a visible is true, the item is made visible. Otherwise, the item is
    made invisible. Invisible items are not painted, nor do they receive any
    events. In particular, mouse events pass right through invisible items,
    and are delivered to any item that may be behind. Invisible items are also
    unselectable, they cannot take input focus, and are not detected by
    QGraphicsScene&apos;s item location functions.

    If an item becomes invisible while grabbing the mouse, (i.e., while it is
    receiving mouse events,) it will automatically lose the mouse grab, and
    the grab is not regained by making the item visible again; it must receive
    a new mouse press to regain the mouse grab.

    Similarly, an invisible item cannot have focus, so if the item has focus
    when it becomes invisible, it will lose focus, and the focus is not
    regained by simply making the item visible again.

    If you hide a parent item, all its children will also be hidden. If you
    show a parent item, all children will be shown, unless they have been
    explicitly hidden (i.e., if you call setVisible(false) on a child, it will
    not be reshown even if its parent is hidden, and then shown again).

    Items are visible by default; it is unnecessary to call
    setVisible() on a new item.

    \note An item with opacity set to 0 will still be considered visible,
    although it will be treated like an invisible item: mouse events will pass
    through it, it will not be included in the items returned by
    QGraphicsView::items(), and so on. However, the item will retain the focus.
