   * Ranges from 0 to 23:59:59.999 (regardless of DST).  This field behaves &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; 
   * like a composite of all time-related fields, not including the zone fields.  As such, 
   * it also reflects discontinuities of those fields on DST transition days.  On a day
   * of DST onset, it will jump forward.  On a day of DST cessation, it will jump 
   * backward.  This reflects the fact that it must be combined with the DST_OFFSET field
   * to obtain a unique local time value.
