    Sets the dash offset (the starting point on the dash pattern) for this pen
    to the \a offset specified. The offset is measured in terms of the units used
    to specify the dash pattern.

    \table
    \row \li \inlineimage qpen-dashpattern.png
    \li For example, a pattern where each stroke is four units long, followed by a gap
    of two units, will begin with the stroke when drawn as a line.

    However, if the dash offset is set to 4.0, any line drawn will begin with the gap.
    Values of the offset up to 4.0 will cause part of the stroke to be drawn first,
    and values of the offset between 4.0 and 6.0 will cause the line to begin with
    part of the gap.
    \endtable

    \note This implicitly converts the style of the pen to Qt::CustomDashLine.
