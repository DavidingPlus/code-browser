    The expose event (\a ev) is sent by the window system when a window moves
    between the un-exposed and exposed states.

    An exposed window is potentially visible to the user. If the window is moved
    off screen, is made totally obscured by another window, is minimized, or
    similar, this function might be called and the value of isExposed() might
    change to false. You may use this event to limit expensive operations such
    as animations to only run when the window is exposed.

    This event should not be used to paint. To handle painting implement
    paintEvent() instead.

    A resize event will always be sent before the expose event the first time
    a window is shown.
