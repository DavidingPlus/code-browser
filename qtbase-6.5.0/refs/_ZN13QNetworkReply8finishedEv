    \fn void QNetworkReply::finished()

    This signal is emitted when the reply has finished
    processing. After this signal is emitted, there will be no more
    updates to the reply&apos;s data or metadata.

    Unless close() or abort() have been called, the reply will still be opened
    for reading, so the data can be retrieved by calls to read() or
    readAll(). In particular, if no calls to read() were made as a
    result of readyRead(), a call to readAll() will retrieve the full
    contents in a QByteArray.

    This signal is emitted in tandem with
    QNetworkAccessManager::finished() where that signal&apos;s reply
    parameter is this object.

    \note Do not delete the object in the slot connected to this
    signal. Use deleteLater().

    You can also use isFinished() to check if a QNetworkReply
    has finished even before you receive the finished() signal.

    \sa QNetworkAccessManager::finished(), isFinished()
