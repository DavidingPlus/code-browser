    \fn void QPrintPreviewDialog::paintRequested(QPrinter *printer)

    This signal is emitted when the QPrintPreviewDialog needs to generate
    a set of preview pages.

    The \a printer instance supplied is the paint device onto which you should
    paint the contents of each page, using the QPrinter instance in the same way
    as you would when printing directly.
