<doc f='include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h' l='734'>/**
 * Sets the current logging verbosity.
 *
 * The library can generate a number of warnings which are not helpful to
 * ordinary users of the library.  The verbosity may be increased if more
 * information is desired (e.g. when developing a new keymap).
 *
 * The default verbosity is 0.  The environment variable XKB_LOG_VERBOSITY,
 * if set in the time the context was created, overrides the default value.
 *
 * @param context   The context in which to use the set verbosity.
 * @param verbosity The verbosity to use.  Currently used values are
 * 1 to 10, higher values being more verbose.  0 would result in no verbose
 * messages being logged.
 *
 * Most verbose messages are of level XKB_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING or lower.
