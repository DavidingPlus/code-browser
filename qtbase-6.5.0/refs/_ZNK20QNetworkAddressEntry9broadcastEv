    Returns the broadcast address associated with the IPv4
    address and netmask. It can usually be derived from those two by
    setting to 1 the bits of the IP address where the netmask contains
    a 0. (In other words, by bitwise-OR&apos;ing the IP address with the
    inverse of the netmask)

    This member is always empty for IPv6 addresses, since the concept
    of broadcast has been abandoned in that system in favor of
    multicast. In particular, the group of hosts corresponding to all
    the nodes in the local network can be reached by the &quot;all-nodes&quot;
    special multicast group (address FF02::1).
