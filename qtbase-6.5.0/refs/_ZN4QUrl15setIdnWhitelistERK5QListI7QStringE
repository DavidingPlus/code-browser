    \since 4.2

    Sets the whitelist of Top-Level Domains (TLDs) that are allowed to have
    non-ASCII characters in domains to the value of \a list.

    Note that if you call this function, you need to do so \e before
    you start any threads that might access idnWhitelist().

    Qt comes with a default list that contains the Internet top-level domains
    that have published support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)
    and rules to guarantee that no deception can happen between similarly-looking
    characters (such as the Latin lowercase letter \c &apos;a&apos; and the Cyrillic
    equivalent, which in most fonts are visually identical).

    This list is periodically maintained, as registrars publish new rules.

    This function is provided for those who need to manipulate the list, in
    order to add or remove a TLD. It is not recommended to change its value
    for purposes other than testing, as it may expose users to security risks.
