  Returns the last query that was successfully executed.

  In most cases this function returns the same string as lastQuery().
  If a prepared query with placeholders is executed on a DBMS that
  does not support it, the preparation of this query is emulated. The
  placeholders in the original query are replaced with their bound
  values to form a new query. This function returns the modified
  query. It is mostly useful for debugging purposes.
