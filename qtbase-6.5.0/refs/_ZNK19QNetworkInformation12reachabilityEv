    \property QNetworkInformation::reachability
    \brief The current state of the system&apos;s network connectivity.

    Indicates the level of connectivity that can be expected. Do note
    that this is only based on what the plugin/operating system
    reports. In certain scenarios this is known to be wrong. For
    example, on Windows the &apos;Online&apos; check, by default, is performed
    by Windows connecting to a Microsoft-owned server. If this server
    is for any reason blocked then it will assume it does not have
    Online reachability. Because of this you should not use this as a
    pre-check before attempting to make a connection.
