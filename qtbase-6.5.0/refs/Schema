** An instance of the following structure stores a database schema.
**
** Most Schema objects are associated with a Btree.  The exception is
** the Schema for the TEMP databaes (sqlite3.aDb[1]) which is free-standing.
** In shared cache mode, a single Schema object can be shared by multiple
** Btrees that refer to the same underlying BtShared object.
**
** Schema objects are automatically deallocated when the last Btree that
** references them is destroyed.   The TEMP Schema is manually freed by
** sqlite3_close().
*
** A thread must be holding a mutex on the corresponding Btree in order
** to access Schema content.  This implies that the thread must also be
** holding a mutex on the sqlite3 connection pointer that owns the Btree.
** For a TEMP Schema, only the connection mutex is required.
