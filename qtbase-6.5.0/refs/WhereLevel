** This object contains information needed to implement a single nested
** loop in WHERE clause.
**
** Contrast this object with WhereLoop.  This object describes the
** implementation of the loop.  WhereLoop describes the algorithm.
** This object contains a pointer to the WhereLoop algorithm as one of
** its elements.
**
** The WhereInfo object contains a single instance of this object for
** each term in the FROM clause (which is to say, for each of the
** nested loops as implemented).  The order of WhereLevel objects determines
** the loop nested order, with WhereInfo.a[0] being the outer loop and
** WhereInfo.a[WhereInfo.nLevel-1] being the inner loop.
