    \since 5.4

    Returns the type of the operating system kernel Qt was compiled for. It&apos;s
    also the kernel the application is running on, unless the host operating
    system is running a form of compatibility or virtualization layer.

    Values returned by this function are stable and will not change over time,
    so applications can rely on the returned value as an identifier, except
    that new OS kernel types may be added over time.

    On Windows, this function returns the type of Windows kernel, like &quot;winnt&quot;.
    On Unix systems, it returns the same as the output of \c{uname
    -s} (lowercased).

    \note This function may return surprising values: it returns &quot;linux&quot;
    for all operating systems running Linux (including Android), &quot;qnx&quot; for all
    operating systems running QNX, &quot;freebsd&quot; for
    Debian/kFreeBSD, and &quot;darwin&quot; for \macos and iOS. For information on the type
    of product the application is running on, see productType().
