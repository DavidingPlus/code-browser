    \fn QCborValue QCborMap::toCborValue() const

    Explicitly constructs a \l QCborValue object that represents this map.
    This function is usually not necessary since QCborValue has a constructor
    for QCborMap, so the conversion is implicit.

    Converting QCborMap to QCborValue allows it to be used in any context where
    QCborValues can be used, including as keys and mapped types in QCborMap, as
    well as QCborValue::toCbor().

    \sa QCborValue::QCborValue(const QCborMap &amp;)
