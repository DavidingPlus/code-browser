   Terminates the map started by either overload of startMap() and returns
   true if the correct number of elements was added to the array. This function
   must be called for every startMap() used.

   A return of false indicates error in the application and an unrecoverable
   error in this stream. QCborStreamWriter also writes a warning using
   qWarning() if that happens.

   Calling this function when the current container is not a map is also an
   error, though QCborStreamWriter cannot currently detect this condition.
