    \brief the thread expiry timeout value in milliseconds.

    Threads that are unused for \e expiryTimeout milliseconds are considered
    to have expired and will exit. Such threads will be restarted as needed.
    The default \a expiryTimeout is 30000 milliseconds (30 seconds). If
    \a expiryTimeout is negative, newly created threads will not expire, e.g.,
    they will not exit until the thread pool is destroyed.

    Note that setting \a expiryTimeout has no effect on already running
    threads. Only newly created threads will use the new \a expiryTimeout.
    We recommend setting the \a expiryTimeout immediately after creating the
    thread pool, but before calling start().
