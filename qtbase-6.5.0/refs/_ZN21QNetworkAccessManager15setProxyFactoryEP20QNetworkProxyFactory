    \since 4.5

    Sets the proxy factory for this class to be \a factory. A proxy
    factory is used to determine a more specific list of proxies to be
    used for a given request, instead of trying to use the same proxy
    value for all requests.

    All queries sent by QNetworkAccessManager will have type
    QNetworkProxyQuery::UrlRequest.

    For example, a proxy factory could apply the following rules:
    \list
      \li if the target address is in the local network (for example,
         if the hostname contains no dots or if it&apos;s an IP address in
         the organization&apos;s range), return QNetworkProxy::NoProxy
      \li if the request is FTP, return an FTP proxy
      \li if the request is HTTP or HTTPS, then return an HTTP proxy
      \li otherwise, return a SOCKSv5 proxy server
    \endlist

    The lifetime of the object \a factory will be managed by
    QNetworkAccessManager. It will delete the object when necessary.

    \note If a specific proxy is set with setProxy(), the factory will not
    be used.
