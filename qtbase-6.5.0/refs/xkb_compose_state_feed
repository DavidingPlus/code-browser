 * Feed one keysym to the Compose sequence state machine.
 *
 * This function can advance into a compose sequence, cancel a sequence,
 * start a new sequence, or do nothing in particular.  The resulting
 * status may be observed with xkb_compose_state_get_status().
 *
 * Some keysyms, such as keysyms for modifier keys, are ignored - they
 * have no effect on the status or otherwise.
 *
 * The following is a description of the possible status transitions, in
 * the format CURRENT STATUS =&gt; NEXT STATUS, given a non-ignored input
 * keysym `keysym`:
 *
   @verbatim
   NOTHING or CANCELLED or COMPOSED =&gt;
      NOTHING   if keysym does not start a sequence.
      COMPOSING if keysym starts a sequence.
      COMPOSED  if keysym starts and terminates a single-keysym sequence.

   COMPOSING =&gt;
      COMPOSING if keysym advances any of the currently possible
                sequences but does not terminate any of them.
      COMPOSED  if keysym terminates one of the currently possible
                sequences.
      CANCELLED if keysym does not advance any of the currently
                possible sequences.
   @endverbatim
 *
 * The current Compose formats do not support multiple-keysyms.
 * Therefore, if you are using a function such as xkb_state_key_get_syms()
 * and it returns more than one keysym, consider feeding XKB_KEY_NoSymbol
 * instead.
 *
 * @param state
 *     The compose state object.
 * @param keysym
 *     A keysym, usually obtained after a key-press event, with a
 *     function such as xkb_state_key_get_one_sym().
 *
 * @returns Whether the keysym was ignored.  This is useful, for example,
 * if you want to keep a record of the sequence matched thus far.
