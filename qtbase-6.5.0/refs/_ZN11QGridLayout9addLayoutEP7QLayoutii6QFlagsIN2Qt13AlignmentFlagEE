    Places the \a layout at position (\a row, \a column) in the grid. The
    top-left position is (0, 0).

    The alignment is specified by \a alignment. The default
    alignment is 0, which means that the widget fills the entire cell.

    A non-zero alignment indicates that the layout should not grow to
    fill the available space but should be sized according to
    sizeHint().


    \a layout becomes a child of the grid layout.
