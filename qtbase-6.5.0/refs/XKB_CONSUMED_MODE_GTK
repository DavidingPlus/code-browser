     * This is the mode used by the GTK+ toolkit.
     *
     * The mode consists of the following two independent heuristics:
     *
     * - The currently active set of modifiers, excluding modifiers which do
     *   not affect the key (as described for @ref XKB_CONSUMED_MODE_XKB), are
     *   considered consumed, if the keysyms produced when all of them are
     *   active are different from the keysyms produced when no modifiers are
     *   active.
     *
     * - A single modifier is considered consumed if the keysyms produced for
     *   the key when it is the only active modifier are different from the
     *   keysyms produced when no modifiers are active.
