    Looks up the IP address(es) associated with host name \a name, and
    returns an ID for the lookup. When the result of the lookup is
    ready, the slot or signal \a member in \a receiver is called with
    a QHostInfo argument. The QHostInfo object can then be inspected
    to get the results of the lookup.

    The lookup is performed by a single function call, for example:

    \snippet code/src_network_kernel_qhostinfo.cpp 2

    The implementation of the slot prints basic information about the
    addresses returned by the lookup, or reports an error if it failed:

    \snippet code/src_network_kernel_qhostinfo.cpp 3

    If you pass a literal IP address to \a name instead of a host name,
    QHostInfo will search for the domain name for the IP (i.e., QHostInfo will
    perform a \e reverse lookup). On success, the resulting QHostInfo will
    contain both the resolved domain name and IP addresses for the host
    name. Example:

    \snippet code/src_network_kernel_qhostinfo.cpp 4

    \note There is no guarantee on the order the signals will be emitted
    if you start multiple requests with lookupHost().
