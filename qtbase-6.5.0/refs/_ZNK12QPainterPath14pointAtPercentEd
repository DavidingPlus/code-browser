    Returns the point at at the percentage \a t of the current path.
    The argument \a t has to be between 0 and 1.

    Note that similarly to other percent methods, the percentage measurement
    is not linear with regards to the length, if curves are present
    in the path. When curves are present the percentage argument is mapped
    to the t parameter of the Bezier equations.
