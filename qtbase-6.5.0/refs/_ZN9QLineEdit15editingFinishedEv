    \fn void  QLineEdit::editingFinished()

    This signal is emitted when the Return or Enter key is pressed, or
    if the line edit loses focus and its contents have changed since the
    last time this signal was emitted.

    Note that if there is a validator() or
    inputMask() set on the line edit and enter/return is pressed, the
    editingFinished() signal will only be emitted if the input follows
    the inputMask() and the validator() returns QValidator::Acceptable.
