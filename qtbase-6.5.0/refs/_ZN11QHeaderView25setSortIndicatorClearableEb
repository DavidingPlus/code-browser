    \property QHeaderView::sortIndicatorClearable
    \brief Whether the sort indicator can be cleared by clicking on a section multiple times
    \since 6.1

    This property controls whether the user is able to remove the
    sorting indicator on a given section by clicking on the section
    multiple times. Normally, clicking on a section will simply change
    the sorting order for that section. By setting this property to
    true, the sorting indicator will be cleared after alternating to
    ascending and descending; this will typically restore the original
    sorting of a model.

    Setting this property to true has no effect unless
    sectionsClickable() is also true (which is the default for certain
    views, for instance QTableView, or is automatically set when making
    a view sortable, for instance by calling
    QTreeView::setSortingEnabled).
