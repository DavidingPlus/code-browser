    Reverts a read transaction.

    This function is commonly used to rollback the transaction when an
    incomplete read was detected prior to committing the transaction.

    If called on an inner transaction, reverting is delegated to the outermost
    transaction, and subsequently started inner transactions are forced to
    fail.

    For the outermost transaction, restores the stream data to the point of
    the startTransaction() call. If the data stream has read corrupt data or
    any of the inner transactions was aborted, this function aborts the
    transaction.

    If the preceding stream operations were successful, sets the status of the
    data stream to \value ReadPastEnd.
