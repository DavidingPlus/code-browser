    \brief whether docks can be nested
    \since 4.2

    If this property is \c false, dock areas can only contain a single row
    (horizontal or vertical) of dock widgets. If this property is \c true,
    the area occupied by a dock widget can be split in either direction to contain
    more dock widgets.

    Dock nesting is only necessary in applications that contain a lot of
    dock widgets. It gives the user greater freedom in organizing their
    main window. However, dock nesting leads to more complex
    (and less intuitive) behavior when a dock widget is dragged over the
    main window, since there are more ways in which a dropped dock widget
    may be placed in the dock area.

    Setting this property is identical to setting the AllowNestedDocks option
    using setDockOptions().
