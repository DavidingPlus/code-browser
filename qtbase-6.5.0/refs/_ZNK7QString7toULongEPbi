    \fn ulong QString::toULong(bool *ok, int base) const

    Returns the string converted to an \c{unsigned long} using base \a
    base, which is 10 by default and must be between 2 and 36, or 0.
    Returns 0 if the conversion fails.

    If \a ok is not \nullptr, failure is reported by setting *\a{ok}
    to \c false, and success by setting *\a{ok} to \c true.

    If \a base is 0, the C language convention is used: if the string begins
    with &quot;0x&quot;, base 16 is used; otherwise, if the string begins with &quot;0b&quot;, base
    2 is used; otherwise, if the string begins with &quot;0&quot;, base 8 is used;
    otherwise, base 10 is used.

    The string conversion will always happen in the &apos;C&apos; locale. For
    locale-dependent conversion use QLocale::toULongLong()

    Example:

    \snippet qstring/main.cpp 78

    This function ignores leading and trailing whitespace.

    \note Support for the &quot;0b&quot; prefix was added in Qt 6.4.
