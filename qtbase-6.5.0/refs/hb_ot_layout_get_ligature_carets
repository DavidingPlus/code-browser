 * hb_ot_layout_get_ligature_carets:
 * @font: The #hb_font_t to work on
 * @direction: The #hb_direction_t text direction to use
 * @glyph: The #hb_codepoint_t code point to query
 * @start_offset: offset of the first caret position to retrieve
 * @caret_count: (inout) (optional): Input = the maximum number of caret positions to return;
 *               Output = the actual number of caret positions returned (may be zero)
 * @caret_array: (out) (array length=caret_count): The array of caret positions found for the query
 *
 * Fetches a list of the caret positions defined for a ligature glyph in the GDEF
 * table of the font. The list returned will begin at the offset provided.
 *
 * Note that a ligature that is formed from n characters will have n-1
 * caret positions. The first character is not represented in the array,
 * since its caret position is the glyph position.
 *
 * The positions returned by this function are &apos;unshaped&apos;, and will have to
 * be fixed up for kerning that may be applied to the ligature glyph.
 *
 * Return value: Total number of ligature caret positions for @glyph.
