    \property QListView::movement
    \brief whether the items can be moved freely, are snapped to a
    grid, or cannot be moved at all.

    This property determines how the user can move the items in the
    view. \l Static means that the items can&apos;t be moved by the user.
    \l Free means that the user can drag and drop the items to any
    position in the view. \l Snap means that the user can drag and
    drop the items, but only to the positions in a notional grid
    signified by the gridSize property.

    Setting this property when the view is visible will cause the
    items to be laid out again.

    By default, this property is set to \l Static.
