    Return the amount of sockets currently in queue for the server.
    This is to make maxPendingConnections work properly with servers that don&apos;t
    necessarily have &apos;ready-to-go&apos; sockets as soon as they connect,
    e.g. QSslServer.
    By default we just return pendingConnections.size(), which is equivalent to
    what it did before.
