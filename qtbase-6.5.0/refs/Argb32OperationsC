<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/painting/qcompositionfunctions.cpp' l='12'>/* The constant alpha factor describes an alpha factor that gets applied
   to the result of the composition operation combining it with the destination.

   The intent is that if const_alpha == 0. we get back dest, and if const_alpha == 1.
   we get the unmodified operation

   result = src op dest
   dest = result * const_alpha + dest * (1. - const_alpha)

   This means that in the comments below, the first line is the const_alpha==255 case, the
   second line the general one.

   In the lines below:
   s == src, sa == alpha(src), sia = 1 - alpha(src)
   d == dest, da == alpha(dest), dia = 1 - alpha(dest)
   ca = const_alpha, cia = 1 - const_alpha

   The methods exist in two variants. One where we have a constant source, the other
   where the source is an array of pixels.
