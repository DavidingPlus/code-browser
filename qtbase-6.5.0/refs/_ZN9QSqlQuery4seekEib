  Retrieves the record at position \a index, if available, and
  positions the query on the retrieved record. The first record is at
  position 0. Note that the query must be in an \l{isActive()}
  {active} state and isSelect() must return true before calling this
  function.

  If \a relative is false (the default), the following rules apply:

  \list

  \li If \a index is negative, the result is positioned before the
  first record and false is returned.

  \li Otherwise, an attempt is made to move to the record at position
  \a index. If the record at position \a index could not be retrieved,
  the result is positioned after the last record and false is
  returned. If the record is successfully retrieved, true is returned.

  \endlist

  If \a relative is true, the following rules apply:

  \list

  \li If the result is currently positioned before the first record and:
  \list
  \li \a index is negative or zero, there is no change, and false is
  returned.
  \li \a index is positive, an attempt is made to position the result
  at absolute position \a index - 1, following the sames rule for non
  relative seek, above.
  \endlist

  \li If the result is currently positioned after the last record and:
  \list
  \li \a index is positive or zero, there is no change, and false is
  returned.
  \li \a index is negative, an attempt is made to position the result
  at \a index + 1 relative position from last record, following the
  rule below.
  \endlist

  \li If the result is currently located somewhere in the middle, and
  the relative offset \a index moves the result below zero, the result
  is positioned before the first record and false is returned.

  \li Otherwise, an attempt is made to move to the record \a index
  records ahead of the current record (or \a index records behind the
  current record if \a index is negative). If the record at offset \a
  index could not be retrieved, the result is positioned after the
  last record if \a index &gt;= 0, (or before the first record if \a
  index is negative), and false is returned. If the record is
  successfully retrieved, true is returned.

  \endlist
