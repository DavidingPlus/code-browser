    \overload

    If the file does not exist and \a mode implies creating it, it is created
    with the specified \a permissions.

    On POSIX systems the actual permissions are influenced by the
    value of \c umask.

    On Windows the permissions are emulated using ACLs. These ACLs may be in non-canonical
    order when the group is granted less permissions than others. Files and directories with
    such permissions will generate warnings when the Security tab of the Properties dialog
    is opened. Granting the group all permissions granted to others avoids such warnings.
