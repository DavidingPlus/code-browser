    \fn void QLocalSocket::setReadBufferSize(qint64 size)

    Sets the size of QLocalSocket&apos;s internal read buffer to be \a size bytes.

    If the buffer size is limited to a certain size, QLocalSocket won&apos;t
    buffer more than this size of data. Exceptionally, a buffer size of 0
    means that the read buffer is unlimited and all incoming data is buffered.
    This is the default.

    This option is useful if you only read the data at certain points in
    time (e.g., in a real-time streaming application) or if you want to
    protect your socket against receiving too much data, which may eventually
    cause your application to run out of memory.
