** CAPI3REF: Configuring The SQLite Library
**
** The sqlite3_config() interface is used to make global configuration
** changes to SQLite in order to tune SQLite to the specific needs of
** the application.  The default configuration is recommended for most
** applications and so this routine is usually not necessary.  It is
** provided to support rare applications with unusual needs.
**
** &lt;b&gt;The sqlite3_config() interface is not threadsafe. The application
** must ensure that no other SQLite interfaces are invoked by other
** threads while sqlite3_config() is running.&lt;/b&gt;
**
** The sqlite3_config() interface
** may only be invoked prior to library initialization using
** [sqlite3_initialize()] or after shutdown by [sqlite3_shutdown()].
** ^If sqlite3_config() is called after [sqlite3_initialize()] and before
** [sqlite3_shutdown()] then it will return SQLITE_MISUSE.
** Note, however, that ^sqlite3_config() can be called as part of the
** implementation of an application-defined [sqlite3_os_init()].
**
** The first argument to sqlite3_config() is an integer
** [configuration option] that determines
** what property of SQLite is to be configured.  Subsequent arguments
** vary depending on the [configuration option]
** in the first argument.
**
** ^When a configuration option is set, sqlite3_config() returns [SQLITE_OK].
** ^If the option is unknown or SQLite is unable to set the option
** then this routine returns a non-zero [error code].
