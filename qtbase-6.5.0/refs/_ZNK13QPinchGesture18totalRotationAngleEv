    \property QPinchGesture::totalRotationAngle
    \brief the total angle covered by the gesture

    This total angle measures the complete angle covered by the gesture. Usually, this
    is equal to the value held by the \l rotationAngle property, except in the case where
    the user performs multiple rotations by removing and repositioning one of the touch
    points, as described above. In this case, the total angle will be the sum of the
    rotation angles for the multiple stages of the gesture.
