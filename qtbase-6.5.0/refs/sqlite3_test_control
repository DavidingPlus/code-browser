** CAPI3REF: Testing Interface

** state of SQLite and to inject faults into SQLite for testing
** purposes.  ^The first parameter is an operation code that determines
** the number, meaning, and operation of all subsequent parameters.
**
** This interface is not for use by applications.  It exists solely
** for verifying the correct operation of the SQLite library.  Depending
** on how the SQLite library is compiled, this interface might not exist.
**
** The details of the operation codes, their meanings, the parameters
** they take, and what they do are all subject to change without notice.
** Unlike most of the SQLite API, this function is not guaranteed to
** operate consistently from one release to the next.
