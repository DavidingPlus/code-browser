 * hb_buffer_set_direction:
 * @buffer: An #hb_buffer_t
 * @direction: the #hb_direction_t of the @buffer
 *
 * Set the text flow direction of the buffer. No shaping can happen without
 * setting @buffer direction, and it controls the visual direction for the
 * output glyphs; for RTL direction the glyphs will be reversed. Many layout
 * features depend on the proper setting of the direction, for example,
 * reversing RTL text before shaping, then shaping with LTR direction is not
 * the same as keeping the text in logical order and shaping with RTL
 * direction.
