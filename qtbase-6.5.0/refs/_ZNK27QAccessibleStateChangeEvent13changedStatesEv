    \fn QAccessible::State QAccessibleStateChangeEvent::changedStates() const
    \brief Returns the states that have been changed.

    Keep in mind that the returned states are the ones that have changed.
    To find out about the state of an object, use QAccessibleInterface::state().

    For example, if an object used to have the focus but loses it,
    the object&apos;s state will have focused set to \c false. This event on the
    other hand tells about the change and has focused set to \c true since
    the focus state is changed from \c true to \c false.
