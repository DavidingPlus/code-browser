   * @enum:
   *   FT_LcdFilter
   *
   * @description:
   *   A list of values to identify various types of LCD filters.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_NONE ::
   *     Do not perform filtering.  When used with subpixel rendering, this
   *     results in sometimes severe color fringes.
   *
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_DEFAULT ::
   *     This is a beveled, normalized, and color-balanced five-tap filter
   *     with weights of [0x08 0x4D 0x56 0x4D 0x08] in 1/256th units.
   *
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_LIGHT ::
   *     this is a boxy, normalized, and color-balanced three-tap filter with
   *     weights of [0x00 0x55 0x56 0x55 0x00] in 1/256th units.
   *
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_LEGACY ::
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_LEGACY1 ::
   *     This filter corresponds to the original libXft color filter.  It
   *     provides high contrast output but can exhibit really bad color
   *     fringes if glyphs are not extremely well hinted to the pixel grid.
   *     This filter is only provided for comparison purposes, and might be
   *     disabled or stay unsupported in the future. The second value is
   *     provided for compatibility with FontConfig, which historically used
   *     different enumeration, sometimes incorrectly forwarded to FreeType.
   *
   * @since:
   *   2.3.0 (`FT_LCD_FILTER_LEGACY1` since 2.6.2)
