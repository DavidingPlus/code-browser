    Sets the hop count limit associated with this datagram to \a count. The hop
    count limit is the number of nodes that are allowed to forward the IP
    packet before it expires and an error is sent back to the sender of the
    datagram. In IPv4, this value is usually known as &quot;time to live&quot; (TTL).

    It is usually not necessary to call this function on datagrams received
    from the network.

    If this is an outgoing packet, this is the value to be set in the IP header
    upon sending. The valid range for the value is 1 to 255. This function also
    accepts a value of -1 to indicate that the operating system should choose
    the value.
