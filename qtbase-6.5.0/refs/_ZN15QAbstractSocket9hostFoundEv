    \fn void QAbstractSocket::hostFound()

    This signal is emitted after connectToHost() has been called and
    the host lookup has succeeded.

    \note Since Qt 4.6.3 QAbstractSocket may emit hostFound()
    directly from the connectToHost() call since a DNS result could have been
    cached.
