    \since 4.5

    Removes any server instance that might cause a call to listen() to fail
    and returns \c true if successful; otherwise returns \c false.
    This function is meant to recover from a crash, when the previous server
    instance has not been cleaned up.

    On Windows, this function does nothing; on Unix, it removes the socket file
    given by \a name.

    \warning Be careful to avoid removing sockets of running instances.
