<doc f='include/c++/9/cxxabi.h' l='659'>/** @namespace abi
 *  @brief The cross-vendor C++ Application Binary Interface. A
 *  namespace alias to __cxxabiv1, but user programs should use the
 *  alias &apos;abi&apos;.
 *
 *  A brief overview of an ABI is given in the libstdc++ FAQ, question
 *  5.8 (you may have a copy of the FAQ locally, or you can view the online
 *  version at http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq.html#5_8 ).
 *
 *  GCC subscribes to a cross-vendor ABI for C++, sometimes
 *  called the IA64 ABI because it happens to be the native ABI for that
 *  platform.  It is summarized at http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/
 *  along with the current specification.
 *
 *  For users of GCC greater than or equal to 3.x, entry points are
 *  available in &lt;cxxabi.h&gt;, which notes, &lt;em&gt;&apos;It is not normally
 *  necessary for user programs to include this header, or use the
 *  entry points directly.  However, this header is available should
 *  that be needed.&apos;&lt;/em&gt;
