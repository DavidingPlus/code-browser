    Specifies the curve flattening \a threshold, controlling the
    granularity with which the generated outlines&apos; curve is drawn.

    The default threshold is a well adjusted value (0.25), and
    normally you should not need to modify it. However, you can make
    the curve&apos;s appearance smoother by decreasing its value.
