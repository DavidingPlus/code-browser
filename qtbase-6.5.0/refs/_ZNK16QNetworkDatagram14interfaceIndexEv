    Returns the interface index this datagram is associated with. The interface
    index is a positive number that uniquely identifies the network interface
    in the operating system. This number matches the value returned by
    QNetworkInterface::index() for the interface.

    If this datagram was received from the network, this is the index of the
    interface that the packet was received from. If this is an outgoing
    datagram, this is the index of the interface that the datagram should be
    sent on.

    A value of 0 indicates that the interface index is unknown.
