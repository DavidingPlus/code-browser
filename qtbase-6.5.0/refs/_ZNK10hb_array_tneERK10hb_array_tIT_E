   * it&apos;s best if we can just compare arrayZ, though comparing contents is still fast,
   * but also would require that Type has operator==.  As such, we optimize this operator
   * for range-based for loop and just compare arrayZ and length.

   * The above comment is outdated now because we implemented separate begin/end to
