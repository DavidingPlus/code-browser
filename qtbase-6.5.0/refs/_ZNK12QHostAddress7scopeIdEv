    Returns the scope ID of an IPv6 address. For IPv4 addresses, or if the
    address does not contain a scope ID, an empty QString is returned.

    The IPv6 scope ID specifies the scope of \e reachability for non-global
    IPv6 addresses, limiting the area in which the address can be used. All
    IPv6 addresses are associated with such a reachability scope. The scope ID
    is used to disambiguate addresses that are not guaranteed to be globally
    unique.

    IPv6 specifies the following four levels of reachability:

    \list

    \li Node-local: Addresses that are only used for communicating with
    services on the same interface (e.g., the loopback interface &quot;::1&quot;).

    \li Link-local: Addresses that are local to the network interface
    (\e{link}). There is always one link-local address for each IPv6 interface
    on your host. Link-local addresses (&quot;fe80...&quot;) are generated from the MAC
    address of the local network adaptor, and are not guaranteed to be unique.

    \li Global: For globally routable addresses, such as public servers on the
    Internet.

    \endlist

    When using a link-local or site-local address for IPv6 connections, you
    must specify the scope ID. The scope ID for a link-local address is
    usually the same as the interface name (e.g., &quot;eth0&quot;, &quot;en1&quot;) or number
    (e.g., &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;).
