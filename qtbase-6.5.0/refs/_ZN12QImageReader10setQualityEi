    Sets the quality setting of the image format to \a quality.

    Some image formats, in particular lossy ones, entail a tradeoff between a)
    visual quality of the resulting image, and b) decoding execution time.
    This function sets the level of that tradeoff for image formats that
    support it.

    In case of scaled image reading, the quality setting may also influence the
    tradeoff level between visual quality and execution speed of the scaling
    algorithm.

    The value range of \a quality depends on the image format. For example,
    the &quot;jpeg&quot; format supports a quality range from 0 (low visual quality) to
    100 (high visual quality).
