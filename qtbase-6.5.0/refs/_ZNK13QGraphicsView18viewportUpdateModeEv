    \property QGraphicsView::viewportUpdateMode
    \brief how the viewport should update its contents.

    \since 4.3

    QGraphicsView uses this property to decide how to update areas of the
    scene that have been reexposed or changed. Usually you do not need to
    modify this property, but there are some cases where doing so can improve
    rendering performance. See the ViewportUpdateMode documentation for
    specific details.

    The default value is MinimalViewportUpdate, where QGraphicsView will
    update as small an area of the viewport as possible when the contents
    change.
