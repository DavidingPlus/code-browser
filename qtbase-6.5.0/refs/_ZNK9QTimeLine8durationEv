    \property QTimeLine::duration
    \brief the total duration of the timeline in milliseconds.

    By default, this value is 1000 (i.e., 1 second), but you can change this
    by either passing a duration to QTimeLine&apos;s constructor, or by calling
    setDuration(). The duration must be larger than 0.

    \note Changing the duration does not cause the current time to be reset
    to zero or the new duration. You also need to call setCurrentTime() with
    the desired value.
