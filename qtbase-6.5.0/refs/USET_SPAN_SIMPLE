     * Continues a span() while there is a set element at the current position.
     * Increments by the longest matching element at each position.
     * (For characters only, this is like while contains(current)==TRUE).
     *
     * When span() returns, the substring between where it started and the position
     * it returned consists only of set elements (characters or strings) that are in the set.
     *
     * If a set only contains single characters, then this is the same
     * as USET_SPAN_CONTAINED.
     *
     * If a set contains strings, then the span will be the longest substring
     * with a match at each position with the longest single set element (character or string).
     *
     * Use this span condition together with other longest-match algorithms,
     * such as ICU converters (ucnv_getUnicodeSet()).
