    Returns the relative position of the cursor within the block.
    The cursor is positioned between characters.

    This is equivalent to \c{ position() - block().position()}.

    \note The &quot;characters&quot; in this case refer to the string of QChar
    objects, i.e. 16-bit Unicode characters, and the position is considered
    an index into this string. This does not necessarily correspond to
    individual graphemes in the writing system, as a single grapheme may
    be represented by multiple Unicode characters, such as in the case
    of surrogate pairs, linguistic ligatures or diacritics.
