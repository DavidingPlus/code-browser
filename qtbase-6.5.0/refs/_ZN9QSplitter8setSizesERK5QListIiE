    Sets the child widgets&apos; respective sizes to the values given in the \a list.

    If the splitter is horizontal, the values set the width of each
    widget in pixels, from left to right. If the splitter is vertical, the
    height of each widget is set, from top to bottom.

    Extra values in the \a list are ignored. If \a list contains too few
    values, the result is undefined, but the program will still be well-behaved.

    The overall size of the splitter widget is not affected.
    Instead, any additional/missing space is distributed amongst the
    widgets according to the relative weight of the sizes.

    If you specify a size of 0, the widget will be invisible. The size policies
    of the widgets are preserved. That is, a value smaller than the minimal size
    hint of the respective widget will be replaced by the value of the hint.
