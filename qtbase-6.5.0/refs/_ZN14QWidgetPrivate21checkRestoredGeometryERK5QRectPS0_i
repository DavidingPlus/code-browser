   Check a if \a restoredGeometry fits into \a availableGeometry
   This method is used to verify that a widget is restored to a geometry, which
   fits into the target screen.

   \param frameHeight represents the height of the widget&apos;s title bar, which is expected
   to be on its top.

   If the size of \a restoredGeometry exceeds \a availableGeometry, its height and width
   will be resized to be two pixels smaller than \a availableGeometry. An exact match would
   be full screen.

   If at least one edge of \a restoredGeometry is outside \a availableGeometry,
   \a restoredGeometry will be moved
   \list
   \li down if its top is off screen
   \li up if its bottom is off screen
   \li right if its left edge is off screen
   \li left if its right edge is off screen
   \endlist
