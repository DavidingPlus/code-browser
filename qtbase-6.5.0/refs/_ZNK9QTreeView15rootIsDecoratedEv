  \property QTreeView::rootIsDecorated
  \brief whether to show controls for expanding and collapsing top-level items

  Items with children are typically shown with controls to expand and collapse
  them, allowing their children to be shown or hidden. If this property is
  false, these controls are not shown for top-level items. This can be used to
  make a single level tree structure appear like a simple list of items.

  By default, this property is \c true.
