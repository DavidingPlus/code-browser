<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='2248'>\value Static Indicates that the data is expected to change only
    infrequently. Typically placed in device local (GPU) memory, where
    applicable. On backends where host visible staging buffers are used for
    uploading, the staging buffers are kept around for this type, unlike with
    Immutable, so subsequent uploads do not suffer in performance. Frequent
    updates, especially updates in consecutive frames, should be avoided.</doc>
