    Sets the item delegate used to render items in the views in the
    file dialog to the given \a delegate.

    Any existing delegate will be removed, but not deleted. QFileDialog
    does not take ownership of \a delegate.

    \warning You should not share the same instance of a delegate between views.
    Doing so can cause incorrect or unintuitive editing behavior since each
    view connected to a given delegate may receive the \l{QAbstractItemDelegate::}{closeEditor()}
    signal, and attempt to access, modify or close an editor that has already been closed.

    Note that the model used is QFileSystemModel. It has custom item data roles, which is
    described by the \l{QFileSystemModel::}{Roles} enum. You can use a QFileIconProvider if
    you only want custom icons.
