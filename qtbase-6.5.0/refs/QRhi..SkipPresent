    swapBuffers call is to be made. This way no image is presented. Generating
    multiple frames with all having this flag set is not recommended (except,
    for example, for benchmarking purposes - but keep in mind that backends may
    behave differently when it comes to waiting for command completion without
    presenting so the results are not comparable between them)</doc>
