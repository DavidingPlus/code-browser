    \fn void QMenu::triggered(QAction *action)

    This signal is emitted when an action in this menu is triggered.

    \a action is the action that caused the signal to be emitted.

    Normally, you connect each menu action&apos;s \l{QAction::}{triggered()} signal
    to its own custom slot, but sometimes you will want to connect several
    actions to a single slot, for example, when you have a group of closely
    related actions, such as &quot;left justify&quot;, &quot;center&quot;, &quot;right justify&quot;.

    \note This signal is emitted for the main parent menu in a hierarchy.
    Hence, only the parent menu needs to be connected to a slot; sub-menus need
    not be connected.
