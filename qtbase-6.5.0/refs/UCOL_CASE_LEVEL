<doc f='include/unicode/ucol.h' l='270'>/** Controls whether an extra case level (positioned before the third
      * level) is generated or not. Acceptable values are UCOL_OFF (default), 
      * when case level is not generated, and UCOL_ON which causes the case
      * level to be generated. Contents of the case level are affected by
      * the value of UCOL_CASE_FIRST attribute. A simple way to ignore 
      * accent differences in a string is to set the strength to UCOL_PRIMARY
      * and enable case level.
