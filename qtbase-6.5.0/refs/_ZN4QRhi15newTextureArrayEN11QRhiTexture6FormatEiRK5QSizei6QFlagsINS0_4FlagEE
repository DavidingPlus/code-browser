    \return a new 1D or 2D texture array with the specified \a format, \a arraySize,
    \a pixelSize, \a sampleCount, and \a flags.

    This function implicitly sets QRhiTexture::TextureArray in \a flags.

    A 1D texture array must have QRhiTexture::OneDimensional set in \a flags.  This
    function will implicitly set this flag if the \a pixelSize height is 0.

    \note Do not confuse texture arrays with arrays of textures. A QRhiTexture
    created by this function is usable with 1D or 2D array samplers in the shader, for
    example: \c{layout(binding = 1) uniform sampler2DArray texArr;}. Arrays of
    textures refers to a list of textures that are exposed to the shader via
    QRhiShaderResourceBinding::sampledTextures() and a count &gt; 1, and declared
    in the shader for example like this: \c{layout(binding = 1) uniform
    sampler2D textures[4];}

    \note This is only functional when the TextureArrays feature is reported as
    supported at run time.

    \note 1D textures are only functional when the OneDimensionalTextures feature is
    reported as supported at run time. Further, mipmaps on 1D textures are only
    functional when the OneDimensionalTextureMipmaps feature is reported at run time.
