    Connects to the IP address and port specified by \a address and \a
    port. If the connection is established, this function returns \c true
    and the socket enters ConnectedState. Otherwise, false is
    returned.

    If false is returned, state() should be called to see if the
    socket is in ConnectingState. If so, a delayed TCP connection is
    taking place, and connectToHost() must be called again later to
    determine if the connection was established successfully or
    not. The second connection attempt must be made when the socket is
    ready for writing. This state can be determined either by
    connecting a QSocketNotifier to the socket descriptor returned by
    socketDescriptor(), or by calling the blocking function
    waitForWrite().

    Example:
    \snippet code/src_network_socket_qnativesocketengine.cpp 0

    Otherwise, error() should be called to determine the cause of the
    error.
