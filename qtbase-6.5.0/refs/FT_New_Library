   * @function:
   *   FT_New_Library
   *
   * @description:
   *   This function is used to create a new FreeType library instance from a
   *   given memory object.  It is thus possible to use libraries with
   *   distinct memory allocators within the same program.  Note, however,
   *   that the used @FT_Memory structure is expected to remain valid for the
   *   life of the @FT_Library object.
   *
   *   Normally, you would call this function (followed by a call to
   *   @FT_Add_Default_Modules or a series of calls to @FT_Add_Module, and a
   *   call to @FT_Set_Default_Properties) instead of @FT_Init_FreeType to
   *   initialize the FreeType library.
   *
   *   Don&apos;t use @FT_Done_FreeType but @FT_Done_Library to destroy a library
   *   instance.
   *
   * @input:
   *   memory ::
   *     A handle to the original memory object.
   *
   * @output:
   *   alibrary ::
   *     A pointer to handle of a new library object.
   *
   * @return:
   *   FreeType error code.  0~means success.
   *
   * @note:
   *   See the discussion of reference counters in the description of
   *   @FT_Reference_Library.
