 * hb_buffer_set_content_type:
 * @buffer: An #hb_buffer_t
 * @content_type: The type of buffer contents to set
 *
 * Sets the type of @buffer contents. Buffers are either empty, contain
 * characters (before shaping), or contain glyphs (the result of shaping).
 *
 * You rarely need to call this function, since a number of other
 * functions transition the content type for you. Namely:
 *
 * - A newly created buffer starts with content type
 *   %HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_INVALID. Calling hb_buffer_reset(),
 *   hb_buffer_clear_contents(), as well as calling hb_buffer_set_length()
 *   with an argument of zero all set the buffer content type to invalid
 *   as well.
 *
 * - Calling hb_buffer_add_utf8(), hb_buffer_add_utf16(),
 *   hb_buffer_add_utf32(), hb_buffer_add_codepoints() and
 *   hb_buffer_add_latin1() expect that buffer is either empty and
 *   have a content type of invalid, or that buffer content type is
 *   %HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_UNICODE, and they also set the content
 *   type to Unicode if they added anything to an empty buffer.
 *
 * - Finally hb_shape() and hb_shape_full() expect that the buffer
 *   is either empty and have content type of invalid, or that buffer
 *   content type is %HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_UNICODE, and upon
 *   success they set the buffer content type to
 *   %HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_GLYPHS.
 *
 * The above transitions are designed such that one can use a buffer
 * in a loop of &quot;reset : add-text : shape&quot; without needing to ever
 * modify the content type manually.
 *
 * Since: 0.9.5
