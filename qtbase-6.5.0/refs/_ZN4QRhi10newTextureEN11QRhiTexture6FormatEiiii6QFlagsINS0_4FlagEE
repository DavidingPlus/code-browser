    \return a new 1D, 2D or 3D texture with the specified \a format, \a width, \a
    height, \a depth, \a sampleCount, and \a flags.

    This overload is suitable for 3D textures because it allows specifying \a
    depth. A 3D texture must have QRhiTexture::ThreeDimensional set in \a
    flags, but using this overload that can be omitted because the flag is set
    implicitly whenever \a depth is greater than 0. For 1D, 2D and cube textures \a
    depth should be set to 0.

    A 1D texture must have QRhiTexture::OneDimensional set in \a flags.  This overload
    will implicitly set this flag if both \a height and \a depth are 0.

    \note 3D textures are only functional when the ThreeDimensionalTextures
    feature is reported as supported at run time.

    \note 1D textures are only functional when the OneDimensionalTextures feature is
    reported as supported at run time. Further, mipmaps on 1D textures are only
    functional when the OneDimensionalTextureMipmaps feature is reported at run time.
