    Tells the splitter that the child widget described by \a c has been
    inserted or removed.

    This method is also used to handle the situation where a widget is created
    with the splitter as a parent but not explicitly added with insertWidget()
    or addWidget(). This is for compatibility and not the recommended way of
    putting widgets into a splitter in new code. Please use insertWidget() or
    addWidget() in new code.

    \sa addWidget(), insertWidget()
