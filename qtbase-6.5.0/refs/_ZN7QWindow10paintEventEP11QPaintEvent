    The paint event (\a ev) is sent by the window system whenever an area of
    the window needs a repaint, for example when initially showing the window,
    or due to parts of the window being uncovered by moving another window.

    The application is expected to render into the window in response to the
    paint event, regardless of the exposed state of the window. For example,
    a paint event may be sent before the window is exposed, to prepare it for
    showing to the user.
