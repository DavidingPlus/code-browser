    \property QUndoStack::undoLimit
    \brief the maximum number of commands on this stack.
    \since 4.3

    When the number of commands on a stack exceedes the stack&apos;s undoLimit, commands are
    deleted from the bottom of the stack. Macro commands (commands with child commands)
    are treated as one command. The default value is 0, which means that there is no
    limit.

    This property may only be set when the undo stack is empty, since setting it on a
    non-empty stack might delete the command at the current index. Calling setUndoLimit()
    on a non-empty stack prints a warning and does nothing.
