    \since 5.4
    \brief The QByteArrayList class provides a list of byte arrays.

    QByteArrayList is actually just a QList&lt;QByteArray&gt;. It is documented as a
    full class just for simplicity of documenting the member methods that exist
    only in QList&lt;QByteArray&gt;.

    All of QList&apos;s functionality also applies to QByteArrayList. For example, you
    can use isEmpty() to test whether the list is empty, and you can call
    functions like append(), prepend(), insert(), replace(), removeAll(),
    removeAt(), removeFirst(), removeLast(), and removeOne() to modify a
    QByteArrayList. In addition, QByteArrayList provides several join()
    methods for concatenating the list into a single QByteArray.

    The purpose of QByteArrayList is quite different from that of QStringList.
    Whereas QStringList has many methods for manipulation of elements within
    the list, QByteArrayList does not.
    Normally, QStringList should be used whenever working with a list of printable
    strings. QByteArrayList should be used to handle and efficiently join large blobs
    of binary data, as when sequentially receiving serialized data through a
    QIODevice.
