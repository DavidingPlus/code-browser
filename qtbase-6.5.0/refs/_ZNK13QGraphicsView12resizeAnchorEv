    \property QGraphicsView::resizeAnchor
    \brief how the view should position the scene when the view is resized.

    QGraphicsView uses this property to decide how to position the scene in
    the viewport when the viewport widget&apos;s size changes. The default
    behavior, NoAnchor, leaves the scene&apos;s position unchanged during a resize;
    the top-left corner of the view will appear to be anchored while resizing.

    Note that the effect of this property is noticeable when only a part of the
    scene is visible (i.e., when there are scroll bars). Otherwise, if the
    whole scene fits in the view, QGraphicsScene uses the view \l alignment to
    position the scene in the view.
