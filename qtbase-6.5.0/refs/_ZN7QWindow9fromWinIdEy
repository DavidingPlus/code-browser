    Creates a local representation of a window created by another process or by
    using native libraries below Qt.

    Given the handle \a id to a native window, this method creates a QWindow
    object which can be used to represent the window when invoking methods like
    setParent() and setTransientParent().

    This can be used, on platforms which support it, to embed a QWindow inside a
    native window, or to embed a native window inside a QWindow.

    If foreign windows are not supported or embedding the native window
    failed in the platform plugin, this function returns \nullptr.

    \note The resulting QWindow should not be used to manipulate the underlying
    native window (besides re-parenting), or to observe state changes of the
    native window. Any support for these kind of operations is incidental, highly
    platform dependent and untested.
