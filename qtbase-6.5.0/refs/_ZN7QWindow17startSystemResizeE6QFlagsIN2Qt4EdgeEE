    \brief Start a system-specific resize operation
    \since 5.15

    Calling this will start an interactive resize operation on the window by platforms
    that support it. The actual behavior may vary depending on the platform. Usually,
    it will make the window resize so that its edge follows the mouse cursor.

    On platforms that support it, this method of resizing windows is preferred over
    \c setGeometry, because it allows a more native look and feel of resizing windows, e.g.
    letting the window manager snap this window against other windows, or special resizing
    behavior with animations when dragged to the edge of the screen.

    \a edges should either be a single edge, or two adjacent edges (a corner). Other values
    are not allowed.

    Returns true if the operation was supported by the system.
