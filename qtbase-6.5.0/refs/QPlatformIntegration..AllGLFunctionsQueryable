<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/kernel/qplatformintegration.cpp' l='194'>\value AllGLFunctionsQueryable Deprecated. Used to indicate whether the QOpenGLContext
    backend provided by the platform is
    able to return function pointers from getProcAddress() even for standard OpenGL
    functions, for example OpenGL 1 functions like glClear() or glDrawArrays(). This is
    important because the OpenGL specifications do not require this ability from the
    getProcAddress implementations of the windowing system interfaces (EGL, WGL, GLX). The
    platform plugins may however choose to enhance the behavior in the backend
    implementation for QOpenGLContext::getProcAddress() and support returning a function
    pointer also for the standard, non-extension functions. This capability is a
    prerequisite for dynamic OpenGL loading. Starting with Qt 5.7, the platform plugin
    is required to have this capability.</doc>
