    Sets the step type for the spin box to \a stepType, which is single
    step or adaptive decimal step.

    Adaptive decimal step means that the step size will continuously be
    adjusted to one power of ten below the current \l value. So when
    the value is 1100, the step is set to 100, so stepping up once
    increases it to 1200. For 1200 stepping up takes it to 1300. For
    negative values, stepping down from -1100 goes to -1200.

    It also works for any decimal values, 0.041 is increased to 0.042
    by stepping once.

    Step direction is taken into account to handle edges cases, so
    that stepping down from 100 takes the value to 99 instead of 90.
    Thus a step up followed by a step down -- or vice versa -- always
    lands on the starting value; 99 -&gt; 100 -&gt; 99.

    Setting this will cause the spin box to disregard the value of
    \l singleStep, although it is preserved so that \l singleStep
    comes into effect if adaptive decimal step is later turned off.
