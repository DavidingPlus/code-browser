   Creates a QCborStreamWriter object that will write the stream to \a device.
   The device must be opened before the first append() call is made. This
   constructor can be used with any class that derives from QIODevice, such as
   QFile, QProcess or QTcpSocket.

   QCborStreamWriter has no buffering, so every append() call will result in
   one or more calls to the device&apos;s \l {QIODevice::}{write()} method.

   The following example writes an empty map to a file:

   \snippet code/src_corelib_serialization_qcborstream.cpp 2

   QCborStreamWriter does not take ownership of \a device.

   \sa device(), setDevice()
