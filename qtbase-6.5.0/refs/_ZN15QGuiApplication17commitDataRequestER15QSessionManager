    \fn void QGuiApplication::commitDataRequest(QSessionManager &amp;manager)

    This signal deals with \l{Session Management}{session management}. It is
    emitted when the QSessionManager wants the application to commit all its
    data.

    Usually this means saving all open files, after getting permission from
    the user. Furthermore you may want to provide a means by which the user
    can cancel the shutdown.

    You should not exit the application within this signal. Instead,
    the session manager may or may not do this afterwards, depending on the
    context.

    \warning Within this signal, no user interaction is possible, \e
    unless you ask the \a manager for explicit permission. See
    QSessionManager::allowsInteraction() and
    QSessionManager::allowsErrorInteraction() for details and example
    usage.

    \note You should use Qt::DirectConnection when connecting to this signal.
