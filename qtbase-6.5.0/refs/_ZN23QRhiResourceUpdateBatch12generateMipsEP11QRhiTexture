   Enqueues a mipmap generation operation for the specified texture \a tex.

   Both 2D and cube textures are supported.

   \note The texture must be created with QRhiTexture::MipMapped and
   QRhiTexture::UsedWithGenerateMips.

   \warning QRhi cannot guarantee that mipmaps can be generated for all
   supported texture formats. For example, QRhiTexture::RGBA32F is not a \c
   filterable format in OpenGL ES 3.0 and Metal on iOS, and therefore the
   mipmap generation request may fail. RGBA8 and RGBA16F are typically
   filterable, so it is recommended to use these formats when mipmap generation
   is desired.
