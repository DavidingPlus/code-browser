    \property QAbstractSpinBox::specialValueText
    \brief the special-value text

    If set, the spin box will display this text instead of a numeric
    value whenever the current value is equal to minimum(). Typical use
    is to indicate that this choice has a special (default) meaning.

    For example, if your spin box allows the user to choose a scale factor
    (or zoom level) for displaying an image, and your application is able
    to automatically choose one that will enable the image to fit completely
    within the display window, you can set up the spin box like this:

    \snippet widgets/spinboxes/window.cpp 3

    The user will then be able to choose a scale from 1% to 1000%
    or select &quot;Auto&quot; to leave it up to the application to choose. Your code
    must then interpret the spin box value of 0 as a request from the user
    to scale the image to fit inside the window.

    All values are displayed with the prefix and suffix (if set), \e
    except for the special value, which only shows the special value
    text. This special text is passed in the QSpinBox::textChanged()
    signal that passes a QString.

    To turn off the special-value text display, call this function
    with an empty string. The default is no special-value text, i.e.
    the numeric value is shown as usual.

    If no special-value text is set, specialValueText() returns an
    empty string.
