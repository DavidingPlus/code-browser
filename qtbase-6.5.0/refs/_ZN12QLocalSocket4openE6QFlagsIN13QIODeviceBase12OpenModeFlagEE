    \fn void QLocalSocket::open(OpenMode openMode)

    Equivalent to connectToServer(OpenMode mode).
    The socket is opened in the given \a openMode to the server defined by setServerName().

    Note that unlike in most other QIODevice subclasses, open() may not open the device directly.
    The function return false if the socket was already connected or if the server to connect
    to was not defined and true in any other case. The connected() or errorOccurred() signals will be
    emitted once the device is actually open (or the connection failed).

    See connectToServer() for more details.
