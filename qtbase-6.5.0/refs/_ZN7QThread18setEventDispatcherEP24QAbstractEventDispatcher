    \since 5.0

    Sets the event dispatcher for the thread to \a eventDispatcher. This is
    only possible as long as there is no event dispatcher installed for the
    thread yet.

    An event dispatcher is automatically created for the main thread when \l
    QCoreApplication is instantiated and on start() for auxiliary threads.

    This method takes ownership of the object.
