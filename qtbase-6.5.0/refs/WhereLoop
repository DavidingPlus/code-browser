** Each instance of this object represents an algorithm for evaluating one
** term of a join.  Every term of the FROM clause will have at least
** one corresponding WhereLoop object (unless INDEXED BY constraints
** prevent a query solution - which is an error) and many terms of the
** FROM clause will have multiple WhereLoop objects, each describing a
** potential way of implementing that FROM-clause term, together with
** dependencies and cost estimates for using the chosen algorithm.
**
** Query planning consists of building up a collection of these WhereLoop
** objects, then computing a particular sequence of WhereLoop objects, with
** one WhereLoop object per FROM clause term, that satisfy all dependencies
** and that minimize the overall cost.
