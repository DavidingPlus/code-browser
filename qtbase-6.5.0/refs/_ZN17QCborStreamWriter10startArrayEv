   Starts a CBOR Array with indeterminate length in the CBOR stream. Each
   startArray() call must be paired with one endArray() call and the current
   CBOR element extends until the end of the array.

   The array created by this function has no explicit length. Instead, its
   length is implied by the elements contained in it. Note, however, that use
   of indeterminate-length arrays is not compliant with canonical CBOR encoding.

   The following example appends elements from the list of strings
   passed as input:

   \snippet code/src_corelib_serialization_qcborstream.cpp 20

   \sa startArray(quint64), endArray(), startMap(), QCborStreamReader::isArray(),
   QCborStreamReader::isLengthKnown()
