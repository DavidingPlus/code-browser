   \fn QCborNegativeValue QCborStreamReader::toNegativeInteger() const

   Returns the negative integer value of the current element.
   QCborNegativeValue is a 64-bit unsigned integer containing the absolute
   value of the negative number that was stored in the CBOR stream.
   Additionally, QCborNegativeValue(0) represents the number -2\sup{64}.

   This function does not perform any type conversions, including from boolean
   or CBOR tag. Therefore, it may only be called if isNegativeInteger() is
   true; calling it in any other condition is an error.

   This function may be used to obtain numbers beyond the range of the return
   type of toInteger(). However, use of negative numbers smaller than -2\sup{63}
   is extremely discouraged.
