    This slot \e advances the scene by one step, by calling
    QGraphicsItem::advance() for all items on the scene. This is done in two
    phases: in the first phase, all items are notified that the scene is about
    to change, and in the second phase all items are notified that they can
    move. In the first phase, QGraphicsItem::advance() is called passing a
    value of 0 as an argument, and 1 is passed in the second phase.

    Note that you can also use the \l{The Animation Framework}{Animation
    Framework} for animations.

    \sa QGraphicsItem::advance(), QTimeLine
