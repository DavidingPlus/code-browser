    \fn void QThread::usleep(unsigned long usecs)

    Forces the current thread to sleep for \a usecs microseconds.

    Avoid using this function if you need to wait for a given condition to
    change. Instead, connect a slot to the signal that indicates the change or
    use an event handler (see \l QObject::event()).

    \note This function does not guarantee accuracy. The application may sleep
    longer than \a usecs under heavy load conditions. Some OSes might round \a
    usecs up to 10 ms or 15 ms; on Windows, it will be rounded up to a multiple
    of 1 ms.
