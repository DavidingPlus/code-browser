    \fn qint64 QLocalSocket::readBufferSize() const

    Returns the size of the internal read buffer. This limits the amount of
    data that the client can receive before you call read() or readAll().
    A read buffer size of 0 (the default) means that the buffer has no size
    limit, ensuring that no data is lost.
