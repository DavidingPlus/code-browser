 \internal

 Used by QML to disconnect a signal by index that&apos;s connected to a slot
 implemented in JavaScript (wrapped in a custom QSlotObjectBase subclass) In the
 QML case the slot is not a pointer to a pointer to the function to disconnect,
 but instead it is a pointer to an array of internal values required for the
 disconnect.

 This is an overload that should be used when \a sender and \a receiver are
 different objects.
