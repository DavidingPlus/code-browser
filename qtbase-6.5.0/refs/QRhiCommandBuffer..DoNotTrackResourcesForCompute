<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='5068'>\value DoNotTrackResourcesForCompute Specifies that there is no need to
    track resources used in this pass if the only purpose of such tracking is
    to generate barriers for compute. Implies that there are no compute passes
    in the frame. This is an optimization hint that may be taken into account
    by certain backends, OpenGL in particular, allowing them to skip certain
    operations. When this flag is set for a render pass in a frame, calling
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::beginComputePass()}{beginComputePass()} in that frame
    may lead to unexpected behavior, depending on the resource dependencies
    between the render and compute passes.</doc>
