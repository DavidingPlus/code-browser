    \property QMovie::cacheMode
    \brief the movie&apos;s cache mode

    Caching frames can be useful when the underlying animation format handler
    that QMovie relies on to decode the animation data does not support
    jumping to particular frames in the animation, or even &quot;rewinding&quot; the
    animation to the beginning (for looping). Furthermore, if the image data
    comes from a sequential device, it is not possible for the underlying
    animation handler to seek back to frames whose data has already been read
    (making looping altogether impossible).

    To aid in such situations, a QMovie object can be instructed to cache the
    frames, at the added memory cost of keeping the frames in memory for the
    lifetime of the object.

    By default, this property is set to \l CacheNone.
