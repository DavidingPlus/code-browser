<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/3rdparty/sqlite/sqlite3.c' l='53674'>/* Each page cache (or PCache) belongs to a PGroup.  A PGroup is a set
** of one or more PCaches that are able to recycle each other&apos;s unpinned
** pages when they are under memory pressure.  A PGroup is an instance of
** the following object.
**
** This page cache implementation works in one of two modes:
**
**   (1)  Every PCache is the sole member of its own PGroup.  There is
**        one PGroup per PCache.
**
**   (2)  There is a single global PGroup that all PCaches are a member
**        of.
**
** Mode 1 uses more memory (since PCache instances are not able to rob
** unused pages from other PCaches) but it also operates without a mutex,
** and is therefore often faster.  Mode 2 requires a mutex in order to be
** threadsafe, but recycles pages more efficiently.
**
** For mode (1), PGroup.mutex is NULL.  For mode (2) there is only a single
** PGroup which is the pcache1.grp global variable and its mutex is
** SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU.
