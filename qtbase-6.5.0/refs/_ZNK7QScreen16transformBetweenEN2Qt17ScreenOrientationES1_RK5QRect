    Convenience function to compute a transform that maps from the coordinate system
    defined by orientation \a a into the coordinate system defined by orientation
    \a b and target dimensions \a target.

    Example, \a a is Qt::Landscape, \a b is Qt::Portrait, and \a target is QRect(0, 0, w, h)
    the resulting transform will be such that the point QPoint(0, 0) is mapped to QPoint(0, w),
    and QPoint(h, w) is mapped to QPoint(0, h). Thus, the landscape coordinate system QRect(0, 0, h, w)
    is mapped (with a 90 degree rotation) into the portrait coordinate system QRect(0, 0, w, h).

    Qt::PrimaryOrientation is interpreted as the screen&apos;s primaryOrientation().
