    \property QTimeLine::currentTime
    \brief the current time of the time line.

    When QTimeLine is in Running state, this value is updated continuously as
    a function of the duration and direction of the timeline. Otherwise, it is
    value that was current when stop() was called last, or the value set by
    setCurrentTime().

    \note You can bind other properties to currentTime, but it is not
    recommended setting bindings to it. As animation progresses, the currentTime
    is updated automatically, which cancels its bindings.

    By default, this property contains a value of 0.
