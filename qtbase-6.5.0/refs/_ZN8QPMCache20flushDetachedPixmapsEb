  This is supposed to cut the cache size down by about 25% in a
  minute once the application becomes idle, to let any inserted pixmap
  remain in the cache for some time before it becomes a candidate for
  cleaning-up, and to not cut down the size of the cache while the
  cache is in active use.

  When the last detached pixmap has been deleted from the cache, kill the
  timer so Qt won&apos;t keep the CPU from going into sleep mode. Currently
  the timer is not restarted when the pixmap becomes unused, but it does
  restart once something else is added (i.e. the cache space is actually needed).

  Returns \c true if any were removed.
