    Returns \c true if the address is an IPv4 or IPv6 global address, \c false
    otherwise. A global address is an address that is not reserved for
    special purposes (like loopback or multicast) or future purposes.

    Note that IPv6 unique local unicast addresses are considered global
    addresses (see isUniqueLocalUnicast()), as are IPv4 addresses reserved for
    local networks by \l {RFC 1918}.

    Also note that IPv6 site-local addresses are deprecated and should be
    considered as global in new applications. This function returns true for
    site-local addresses too.
