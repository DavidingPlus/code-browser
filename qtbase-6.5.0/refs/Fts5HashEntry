** Each entry in the hash table is represented by an object of the
** following type. Each object, its key (a nul-terminated string) and
** its current data are stored in a single memory allocation. The
** key immediately follows the object in memory. The position list
** data immediately follows the key data in memory.
**
** The data that follows the key is in a similar, but not identical format
** to the doclist data stored in the database. It is:
**
**   * Rowid, as a varint
**   * Position list, without 0x00 terminator.
**   * Size of previous position list and rowid, as a 4 byte
**     big-endian integer.
**
** iRowidOff:
**   Offset of last rowid written to data area. Relative to first byte of
**   structure.
**
** nData:
**   Bytes of data written since iRowidOff.
