** CAPI3REF: Total Number Of Rows Modified
** METHOD: sqlite3
**
** ^These functions return the total number of rows inserted, modified or
** deleted by all [INSERT], [UPDATE] or [DELETE] statements completed
** since the database connection was opened, including those executed as
** part of trigger programs. The two functions are identical except for the
** type of the return value and that if the number of rows modified by the
** connection exceeds the maximum value supported by type &quot;int&quot;, then
** the return value of sqlite3_total_changes() is undefined. ^Executing
** any other type of SQL statement does not affect the value returned by
** sqlite3_total_changes().
**
** ^Changes made as part of [foreign key actions] are included in the
** count, but those made as part of REPLACE constraint resolution are
** not. ^Changes to a view that are intercepted by INSTEAD OF triggers
** are not counted.
**
** The [sqlite3_total_changes(D)] interface only reports the number
** of rows that changed due to SQL statement run against database
** connection D.  Any changes by other database connections are ignored.
** To detect changes against a database file from other database
** connections use the [PRAGMA data_version] command or the
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_DATA_VERSION] [file control].
**
** If a separate thread makes changes on the same database connection
** while [sqlite3_total_changes()] is running then the value
** returned is unpredictable and not meaningful.
**
** See also:
** &lt;ul&gt;
** &lt;li&gt; the [sqlite3_changes()] interface
** &lt;li&gt; the [count_changes pragma]
** &lt;li&gt; the [changes() SQL function]
