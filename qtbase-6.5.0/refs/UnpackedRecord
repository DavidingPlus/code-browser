** This object holds a record which has been parsed out into individual
** fields, for the purposes of doing a comparison.
**
** A record is an object that contains one or more fields of data.
** Records are used to store the content of a table row and to store
** the key of an index.  A blob encoding of a record is created by
** the OP_MakeRecord opcode of the VDBE and is disassembled by the
** OP_Column opcode.
**
** An instance of this object serves as a &quot;key&quot; for doing a search on
** an index b+tree. The goal of the search is to find the entry that
** is closed to the key described by this object.  This object might hold
** just a prefix of the key.  The number of fields is given by
** pKeyInfo-&gt;nField.
**
** The r1 and r2 fields are the values to return if this key is less than
** or greater than a key in the btree, respectively.  These are normally
** -1 and +1 respectively, but might be inverted to +1 and -1 if the b-tree
** is in DESC order.
**
** The key comparison functions actually return default_rc when they find
** an equals comparison.  default_rc can be -1, 0, or +1.  If there are
** multiple entries in the b-tree with the same key (when only looking
** at the first pKeyInfo-&gt;nFields,) then default_rc can be set to -1 to
** cause the search to find the last match, or +1 to cause the search to
** find the first match.
**
** The key comparison functions will set eqSeen to true if they ever
** get and equal results when comparing this structure to a b-tree record.
** When default_rc!=0, the search might end up on the record immediately
** before the first match or immediately after the last match.  The
** eqSeen field will indicate whether or not an exact match exists in the
** b-tree.
