    This event handler, for event \a mouseEvent, can be reimplemented
    in a subclass to receive mouse double-click events for the scene.

    If someone doubleclicks on the scene, the scene will first receive
    a mouse press event, followed by a release event (i.e., a click),
    then a double-click event, and finally a release event. If the
    double-click event is delivered to a different item than the one
    that received the first press and release, it will be delivered as
    a press event. However, tripleclick events are not delivered as
    double-click events in this case.

    The default implementation is similar to mousePressEvent().

    Note: See items() for a definition of which items are considered visible by this function.

    QGraphicsItem::mouseReleaseEvent(), QGraphicsItem::setAcceptedMouseButtons()
