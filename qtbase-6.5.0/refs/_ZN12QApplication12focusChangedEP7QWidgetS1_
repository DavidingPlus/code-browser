    This signal is emitted when the widget that has keyboard focus changed from
    \a old to \a now, i.e., because the user pressed the tab-key, clicked into
    a widget or changed the active window. Both \a old and \a now can be \nullptr.


    The signal is emitted after both widget have been notified about the change
    through QFocusEvent.
