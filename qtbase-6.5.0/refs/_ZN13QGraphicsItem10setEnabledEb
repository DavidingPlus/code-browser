    If \a enabled is true, the item is enabled; otherwise, it is disabled.

    Disabled items are visible, but they do not receive any events, and cannot
    take focus nor be selected. Mouse events are discarded; they are not
    propagated unless the item is also invisible, or if it does not accept
    mouse events (see acceptedMouseButtons()). A disabled item cannot become the
    mouse grabber, and as a result of this, an item loses the grab if it
    becomes disabled when grabbing the mouse, just like it loses focus if it
    had focus when it was disabled.

    Disabled items are traditionally drawn using grayed-out colors (see \l
    QPalette::Disabled).

    If you disable a parent item, all its children will also be disabled. If
    you enable a parent item, all children will be enabled, unless they have
    been explicitly disabled (i.e., if you call setEnabled(false) on a child,
    it will not be re-enabled if its parent is disabled, and then enabled
    again).

    Items are enabled by default.

    \note If you install an event filter, you can still intercept events
    before they are delivered to items; this mechanism disregards the item&apos;s
    enabled state.
