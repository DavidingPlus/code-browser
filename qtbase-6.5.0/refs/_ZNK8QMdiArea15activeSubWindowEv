    Returns a pointer to the current active subwindow. If no
    window is currently active, \nullptr is returned.

    Subwindows are treated as top-level windows with respect to
    window state, i.e., if a widget outside the MDI area is the active
    window, no subwindow will be active. Note that if a widget in the
    window in which the MDI area lives gains focus, the window will be
    activated.
