   Starts a CBOR Map with indeterminate length in the CBOR stream. Each
   startMap() call must be paired with one endMap() call and the current CBOR
   element extends until the end of the map.

   The map created by this function has no explicit length. Instead, its length
   is implied by the elements contained in it. Note, however, that use of
   indeterminate-length maps is not compliant with canonical CBOR encoding
   (canonical encoding also requires keys to be unique and in sorted order).

   The following example appends elements from the list of int and
   string pairs passed as input:

   \snippet code/src_corelib_serialization_qcborstream.cpp 22

   \sa startMap(quint64), endMap(), startArray(), QCborStreamReader::isMap(),
       QCborStreamReader::isLengthKnown()
