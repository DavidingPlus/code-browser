    Enters the event loop and waits until exit() is called, returning the value
    that was passed to exit(). The value returned is 0 if exit() is called via
    quit().

    This function is meant to be called from within run(). It is necessary to
    call this function to start event handling.

    \note This can only be called within the thread itself, i.e. when
    it is the current thread.

    \sa quit(), exit()
