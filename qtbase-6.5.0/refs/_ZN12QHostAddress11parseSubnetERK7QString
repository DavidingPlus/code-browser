    \since 4.5

    Parses the IP and subnet information contained in \a subnet and
    returns the network prefix for that network and its prefix length.

    The IP address and the netmask must be separated by a slash
    (/).

    This function supports arguments in the form:
    \list
      \li 123.123.123.123/n  where n is any value between 0 and 32
      \li 123.123.123.123/255.255.255.255
      \li &lt;ipv6-address&gt;/n  where n is any value between 0 and 128
    \endlist

    For IP version 4, this function accepts as well missing trailing
    components (i.e., less than 4 octets, like &quot;192.168.1&quot;), followed
    or not by a dot. If the netmask is also missing in that case, it
    is set to the number of octets actually passed (in the example
    above, it would be 24, for 3 octets).
