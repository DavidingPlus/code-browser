   *  @brief Demangling routine.
   *  ABI-mandated entry point in the C++ runtime library for demangling.
   *
   *  @param __mangled_name A NUL-terminated character string
   *  containing the name to be demangled.
   *
   *  @param __output_buffer A region of memory, allocated with
   *  malloc, of @a *__length bytes, into which the demangled name is
   *  stored.  If @a __output_buffer is not long enough, it is
   *  expanded using realloc.  @a __output_buffer may instead be NULL;
   *  in that case, the demangled name is placed in a region of memory
   *  allocated with malloc.
   *
   *  @param __length If @a __length is non-null, the length of the
   *  buffer containing the demangled name is placed in @a *__length.
   *
   *  @param __status If @a __status is non-null, @a *__status is set to
   *  one of the following values:
   *   0: The demangling operation succeeded.
   *  -1: A memory allocation failure occurred.
   *  -2: @a mangled_name is not a valid name under the C++ ABI mangling rules.
   *  -3: One of the arguments is invalid.
   *
   *  @return A pointer to the start of the NUL-terminated demangled
   *  name, or NULL if the demangling fails.  The caller is
   *  responsible for deallocating this memory using @c free.
   *
   *  The demangling is performed using the C++ ABI mangling rules,
   *  with GNU extensions. For example, this function is used in
   *  __gnu_cxx::__verbose_terminate_handler.
   *
   *  See https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/ext_demangling.html
   *  for other examples of use.
   *
   *  @note The same demangling functionality is available via
   *  libiberty (@c &lt;libiberty/demangle.h&gt; and @c libiberty.a) in GCC
   *  3.1 and later, but that requires explicit installation (@c
   *  --enable-install-libiberty) and uses a different API, although
   *  the ABI is unchanged.
