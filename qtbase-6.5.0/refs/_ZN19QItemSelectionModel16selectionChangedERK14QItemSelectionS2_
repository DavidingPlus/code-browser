    \fn void QItemSelectionModel::selectionChanged(const QItemSelection &amp;selected, const QItemSelection &amp;deselected)

    This signal is emitted whenever the selection changes. The change in the
    selection is represented as an item selection of \a deselected items and
    an item selection of \a selected items.

    Note the that the current index changes independently from the selection.
    Also note that this signal will not be emitted when the item model is reset.

    Items which stay selected but change their index are not included in
    \a selected and \a deselected. Thus, this signal might be emitted with both
    \a selected and \a deselected empty, if only the indices of selected items
    change.

    \sa select(), currentChanged()
