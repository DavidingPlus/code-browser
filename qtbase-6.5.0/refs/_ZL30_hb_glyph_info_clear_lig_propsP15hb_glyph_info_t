 *
 * When a ligature is formed:
 *
 *   - The ligature glyph and any marks in between all the same newly allocated
 *     lig_id,
 *   - The ligature glyph will get lig_num_comps set to the number of components
 *   - The marks get lig_comp &gt; 0, reflecting which component of the ligature
 *     they were applied to.
 *   - This is used in GPOS to attach marks to the right component of a ligature
 *     in MarkLigPos,
 *   - Note that when marks are ligated together, much of the above is skipped
 *     and the current lig_id reused.
 *
 * When a multiple-substitution is done:
 *
 *   - All resulting glyphs will have lig_id = 0,
 *   - The resulting glyphs will have lig_comp = 0, 1, 2, ... respectively.
 *   - This is used in GPOS to attach marks to the first component of a
 *     multiple substitution in MarkBasePos.
 *
 * The numbers are also used in GPOS to do mark-to-mark positioning only
 * to marks that belong to the same component of the same ligature.
