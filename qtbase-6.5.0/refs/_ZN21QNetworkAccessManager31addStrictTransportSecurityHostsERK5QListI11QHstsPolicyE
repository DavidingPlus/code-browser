    \since 5.9

    Adds HTTP Strict Transport Security policies into HSTS cache.
    \a knownHosts contains the known hosts that have QHstsPolicy
    information.

    \note An expired policy will remove a known host from the cache, if previously
    present.

    \note While processing HTTP responses, QNetworkAccessManager can also update
    the HSTS cache, removing or updating exitsting policies or introducing new
    \a knownHosts. The current implementation thus is server-driven, client code
    can provide QNetworkAccessManager with previously known or discovered
    policies, but this information can be overridden by &quot;Strict-Transport-Security&quot;
    response headers.
