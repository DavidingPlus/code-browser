    Looks up the IP address(es) for the given host \a name. The
    function blocks during the lookup which means that execution of
    the program is suspended until the results of the lookup are
    ready. Returns the result of the lookup in a QHostInfo object.

    If you pass a literal IP address to \a name instead of a host name,
    QHostInfo will search for the domain name for the IP (i.e., QHostInfo will
    perform a \e reverse lookup). On success, the returned QHostInfo will
    contain both the resolved domain name and IP addresses for the host name.
