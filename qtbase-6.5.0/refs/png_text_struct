<doc f='include/libpng16/png.h' l='560'>/* png_text holds the contents of a text/ztxt/itxt chunk in a PNG file,
 * and whether that contents is compressed or not.  The &quot;key&quot; field
 * points to a regular zero-terminated C string.  The &quot;text&quot; fields can be a
 * regular C string, an empty string, or a NULL pointer.
 * However, the structure returned by png_get_text() will always contain
 * the &quot;text&quot; field as a regular zero-terminated C string (possibly
 * empty), never a NULL pointer, so it can be safely used in printf() and
 * other string-handling functions.  Note that the &quot;itxt_length&quot;, &quot;lang&quot;, and
 * &quot;lang_key&quot; members of the structure only exist when the library is built
 * with iTXt chunk support.  Prior to libpng-1.4.0 the library was built by
 * default without iTXt support. Also note that when iTXt *is* supported,
 * the &quot;lang&quot; and &quot;lang_key&quot; fields contain NULL pointers when the
 * &quot;compression&quot; field contains * PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_NONE or
 * PNG_TEXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt. Note that the &quot;compression value&quot; is not the
 * same as what appears in the PNG tEXt/zTXt/iTXt chunk&apos;s &quot;compression flag&quot;
 * which is always 0 or 1, or its &quot;compression method&quot; which is always 0.
