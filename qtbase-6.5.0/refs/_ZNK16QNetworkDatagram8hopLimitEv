    Returns the hop count limit associated with this datagram. The hop count
    limit is the number of nodes that are allowed to forward the IP packet
    before it expires and an error is sent back to the sender of the datagram.
    In IPv4, this value is usually known as &quot;time to live&quot; (TTL).

    If this datagram was received from the network, this is the remaining hop
    count of the datagram after reception and was decremented by 1 by each node
    that forwarded the packet. A value of -1 indicates that the hop limit count
    not be obtained.

    If this is an outgoing datagram, this is the value to be set in the IP header
    upon sending. A value of -1 indicates the operating system should choose
    the value.
