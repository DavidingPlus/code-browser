    \property QEventPoint::accepted
    \brief the accepted state of the event point.

    In widget-based applications, this property is not used, as it&apos;s only meaningful
    for a widget to accept or reject a complete QInputEvent.

    In Qt Quick however, it&apos;s normal for an Item or Event Handler to accept
    only the individual points in a QTouchEvent that are actually participating
    in a gesture, while other points can be delivered to other items or
    handlers. For the sake of consistency, that applies to any QPointerEvent;
    and delivery is done only when all points in a QPointerEvent have been
    accepted.

    \sa QEvent::accepted
