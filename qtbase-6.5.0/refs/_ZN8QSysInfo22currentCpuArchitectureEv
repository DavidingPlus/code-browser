    Returns the architecture of the CPU that the application is running on, in
    text format. Note that this function depends on what the OS will report and
    may not detect the actual CPU architecture if the OS hides that information
    or is unable to provide it. For example, a 32-bit OS running on a 64-bit
    CPU is usually unable to determine the CPU is actually capable of running
    64-bit programs.

    Values returned by this function are mostly stable: an attempt will be made
    to ensure that they stay constant over time and match the values returned
    by QSysInfo::builldCpuArchitecture(). However, due to the nature of the
    operating system functions being used, there may be discrepancies.

    Typical returned values are (note: list not exhaustive):
    \list
        \li &quot;arm&quot;
        \li &quot;arm64&quot;
        \li &quot;i386&quot;
        \li &quot;ia64&quot;
        \li &quot;mips&quot;
        \li &quot;mips64&quot;
        \li &quot;power&quot;
        \li &quot;power64&quot;
        \li &quot;sparc&quot;
        \li &quot;sparcv9&quot;
        \li &quot;x86_64&quot;
    \endlist
