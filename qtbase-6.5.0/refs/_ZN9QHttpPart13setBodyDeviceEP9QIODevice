  Sets the device to read the content from to \a device. For large amounts of data
  this method should be preferred over setBody(),
  because the content is not copied when using this method, but read
  directly from the device.
  \a device must be open and readable. QHttpPart does not take ownership
  of \a device, i.e. the device must be closed and destroyed if necessary.
  if \a device is sequential (e.g. sockets, but not files),
  QNetworkAccessManager::post() should be called after \a device has
  emitted finished().
  For unsetting the device and using data set via setBody(), use
  &quot;setBodyDevice(0)&quot;.

  \sa setBody(), QNetworkAccessManager::post()
