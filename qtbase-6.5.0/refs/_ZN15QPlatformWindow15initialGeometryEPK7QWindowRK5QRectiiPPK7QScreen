    Helper function to get initial geometry on windowing systems which do not
    do smart positioning and also do not provide a means of centering a
    transient window w.r.t. its parent. For example this is useful on Windows
    and MacOS but not X11, because an X11 window manager typically tries to
    layout new windows to optimize usage of the available desktop space.
    However if the given window already has geometry which the application has
    initialized, it takes priority.

    \a initialGeometry has to be provided in native pixels.
    \a defaultWidth has to be provided in device independent pixels
    \a defaultHeight has to be provided in device independent pixels
