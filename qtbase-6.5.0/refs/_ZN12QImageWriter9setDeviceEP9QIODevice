    Sets QImageWriter&apos;s device to \a device. If a device has already
    been set, the old device is removed from QImageWriter and is
    otherwise left unchanged.

    If the device is not already open, QImageWriter will attempt to
    open the device in \l QIODevice::WriteOnly mode by calling
    open(). Note that this does not work for certain devices, such as
    QProcess, QTcpSocket and QUdpSocket, where more logic is required
    to open the device.
