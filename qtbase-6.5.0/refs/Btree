**
** A database connection contains a pointer to an instance of
** this object for every database file that it has open.  This structure
** is opaque to the database connection.  The database connection cannot
** see the internals of this structure and only deals with pointers to
** this structure.
**
** For some database files, the same underlying database cache might be
** shared between multiple connections.  In that case, each connection
** has it own instance of this object.  But each instance of this object
** points to the same BtShared object.  The database cache and the
** schema associated with the database file are all contained within
** the BtShared object.
**
** All fields in this structure are accessed under sqlite3.mutex.
** The pBt pointer itself may not be changed while there exists cursors
** in the referenced BtShared that point back to this Btree since those
** cursors have to go through this Btree to find their BtShared and
** they often do so without holding sqlite3.mutex.
