    Deletes row \a row from this form layout.

    \a row must be non-negative and less than rowCount().

    After this call, rowCount() is decremented by one. All widgets and
    nested layouts that occupied this row are deleted. That includes both
    the field widget(s) and the label, if any. All following rows are shifted
    up one row and the freed vertical space is redistributed amongst the remaining rows.

    You can use this function to undo a previous addRow() or insertRow():
    \snippet code/src_gui_kernel_qformlayout.cpp 3

    If you want to remove the row from the layout without deleting the widgets, use takeRow() instead.

    \sa takeRow()
