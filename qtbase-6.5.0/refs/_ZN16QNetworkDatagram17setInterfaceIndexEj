    Sets the interface index this datagram is associated with to \a index. The
    interface index is a positive number that uniquely identifies the network
    interface in the operating system. This number matches the value returned
    by QNetworkInterface::index() for the interface.

    It is usually not necessary to call this function on datagrams received
    from the network.

    If this is an outgoing packet, this is the index of the interface the
    datagram should be sent on. A value of 0 indicates that the operating
    system should choose the interface based on other factors.

    Note that the interface index can also be set with
    QHostAddress::setScopeId() for IPv6 destination addresses and then with
    setDestination(). If the scope ID set in the destination address and \a
    index are different and neither is zero, it is undefined which interface
    the operating system will send the datagram on.
