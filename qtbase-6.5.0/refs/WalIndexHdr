** The following object holds a copy of the wal-index header content.
**
** The actual header in the wal-index consists of two copies of this
** object followed by one instance of the WalCkptInfo object.
** For all versions of SQLite through 3.10.0 and probably beyond,
** the locking bytes (WalCkptInfo.aLock) start at offset 120 and
** the total header size is 136 bytes.
**
** The szPage value can be any power of 2 between 512 and 32768, inclusive.
** Or it can be 1 to represent a 65536-byte page.  The latter case was
** added in 3.7.1 when support for 64K pages was added.
