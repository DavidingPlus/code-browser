    \since 4.2

    Sets the given item \a delegate used by this view and model for the given
    \a row. All items on \a row will be drawn and managed by \a delegate
    instead of using the default delegate (i.e., itemDelegate()).

    Any existing row delegate for \a row will be removed, but not
    deleted. QAbstractItemView does not take ownership of \a delegate.

    \note If a delegate has been assigned to both a row and a column, the row
    delegate (i.e., this delegate) will take precedence and manage the
    intersecting cell index.

    \warning You should not share the same instance of a delegate between views.
    Doing so can cause incorrect or unintuitive editing behavior since each
    view connected to a given delegate may receive the \l{QAbstractItemDelegate::}{closeEditor()}
    signal, and attempt to access, modify or close an editor that has already been closed.
