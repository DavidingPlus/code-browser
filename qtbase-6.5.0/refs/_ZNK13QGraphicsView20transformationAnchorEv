    \property QGraphicsView::transformationAnchor
    \brief how the view should position the scene during transformations.

    QGraphicsView uses this property to decide how to position the scene in
    the viewport when the transformation matrix changes, and the coordinate
    system of the view is transformed. The default behavior, AnchorViewCenter,
    ensures that the scene point at the center of the view remains unchanged
    during transformations (e.g., when rotating, the scene will appear to
    rotate around the center of the view).

    Note that the effect of this property is noticeable when only a part of the
    scene is visible (i.e., when there are scroll bars). Otherwise, if the
    whole scene fits in the view, QGraphicsScene uses the view \l alignment to
    position the scene in the view.
