 * struct input_keymap_entry - used by EVIOCGKEYCODE/EVIOCSKEYCODE ioctls
 * @scancode: scancode represented in machine-endian form.
 * @len: length of the scancode that resides in @scancode buffer.
 * @index: index in the keymap, may be used instead of scancode
 * @flags: allows to specify how kernel should handle the request. For
 *	example, setting INPUT_KEYMAP_BY_INDEX flag indicates that kernel
 *	should perform lookup in keymap by @index instead of @scancode
 * @keycode: key code assigned to this scancode
 *
 * The structure is used to retrieve and modify keymap data. Users have
 * option of performing lookup either by @scancode itself or by @index
 * in keymap entry. EVIOCGKEYCODE will also return scancode or index
 * (depending on which element was used to perform lookup).
