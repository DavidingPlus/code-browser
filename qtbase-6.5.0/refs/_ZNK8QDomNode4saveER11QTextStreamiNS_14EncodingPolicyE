    Writes the XML representation of the node and all its children to
    the stream \a stream. This function uses \a indent as the amount of
    space to indent the node.

    If the document contains invalid XML characters or characters that cannot be
    encoded in the given encoding, the result and behavior is undefined.

    If \a encodingPolicy is QDomNode::EncodingFromDocument and this node is a
    document node, the encoding of text stream \a stream&apos;s encoding is set by
    treating a processing instruction by name &quot;xml&quot; as an XML declaration, if
    one exists, and otherwise defaults to UTF-8. XML declarations are not
    processing instructions, but this behavior exists for historical
    reasons. If this node is not a document node, the text stream&apos;s encoding
    is used.

    If \a encodingPolicy is EncodingFromTextStream and this node is a document node, this
    function behaves as save(QTextStream &amp;str, int indent) with the exception that the encoding
    specified in the text stream \a stream is used.

    If the document contains invalid XML characters or characters that cannot be
    encoded in the given encoding, the result and behavior is undefined.
