<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/rhi/qrhi.cpp' l='566'>\value VertexShaderPointSize Indicates that the size of rasterized points
    set via \c{gl_PointSize} in the vertex shader is taken into account. When
    reported as not supported, drawing points with a size other than 1 is not
    supported. Setting \c{gl_PointSize} in the shader is still valid then, but
    is ignored. (for example, when generating HLSL, the assignment is silently
    dropped from the generated code) Note that some APIs (Metal, Vulkan)
    require the point size to be set in the shader explicitly whenever drawing
    points, even when the size is 1, as they do not automatically default to 1.</doc>
