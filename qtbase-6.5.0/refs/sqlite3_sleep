** CAPI3REF: Suspend Execution For A Short Time
**
** The sqlite3_sleep() function causes the current thread to suspend execution
** for at least a number of milliseconds specified in its parameter.
**
** If the operating system does not support sleep requests with
** millisecond time resolution, then the time will be rounded up to
** the nearest second. The number of milliseconds of sleep actually
** requested from the operating system is returned.
**
** ^SQLite implements this interface by calling the xSleep()
** method of the default [sqlite3_vfs] object.  If the xSleep() method
** of the default VFS is not implemented correctly, or not implemented at
** all, then the behavior of sqlite3_sleep() may deviate from the description
** in the previous paragraphs.
