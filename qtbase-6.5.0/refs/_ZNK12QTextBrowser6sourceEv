    \property QTextBrowser::source
    \brief the name of the displayed document.

    This is a an invalid url if no document is displayed or if the
    source is unknown.

    When setting this property QTextBrowser tries to find a document
    with the specified name in the paths of the searchPaths property
    and directory of the current source, unless the value is an absolute
    file path. It also checks for optional anchors and scrolls the document
    accordingly

    If the first tag in the document is \c{&lt;qt type=detail&gt;}, the
    document is displayed as a popup rather than as new document in
    the browser window itself. Otherwise, the document is displayed
    normally in the text browser with the text set to the contents of
    the named document with \l QTextDocument::setHtml() or
    \l QTextDocument::setMarkdown(), depending on whether the filename ends
    with any of the known Markdown file extensions.

    If you would like to avoid automatic type detection
    and specify the type explicitly, call setSource() rather than
    setting this property.

    By default, this property contains an empty URL.
