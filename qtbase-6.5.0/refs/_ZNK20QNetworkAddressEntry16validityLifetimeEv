    Returns the deadline when this address becomes invalid and will be removed
    from the networking stack, if known. If the address lifetime is not known
    (see isLifetimeKnown()), this function always returns
    QDeadlineTimer::Forever.

    While an address is valid, it will be accepted by the operating system as a
    valid destination address for this machine. Whether it is used as a source
    address for new, outgoing packets is controlled by, among other rules, the
    preferred lifetime (see preferredLifetime()).
