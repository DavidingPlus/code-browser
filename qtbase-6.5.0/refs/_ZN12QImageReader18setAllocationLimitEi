    \since 6.0

    Sets the allocation limit to \a mbLimit megabytes. Images that would
    require a QImage memory allocation above this limit will be rejected.
    If \a mbLimit is 0, the allocation size check will be disabled.

    This limit helps applications avoid unexpectedly large memory usage from
    loading corrupt image files. It is normally not needed to change it. The
    default limit is large enough for all commonly used image sizes.

    \note The memory requirements are calculated for a minimum of 32 bits per pixel, since Qt will
    typically convert an image to that depth when it is used in GUI. This means that the effective
    allocation limit is significantly smaller than \a mbLimit when reading 1 bpp and 8 bpp images.
