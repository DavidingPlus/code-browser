 * hb_buffer_guess_segment_properties:
 * @buffer: An #hb_buffer_t
 *
 * Sets unset buffer segment properties based on buffer Unicode
 * contents.  If buffer is not empty, it must have content type
 * #HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_UNICODE.
 *
 * If buffer script is not set (ie. is #HB_SCRIPT_INVALID), it
 * will be set to the Unicode script of the first character in
 * the buffer that has a script other than #HB_SCRIPT_COMMON,
 * #HB_SCRIPT_INHERITED, and #HB_SCRIPT_UNKNOWN.
 *
 * Next, if buffer direction is not set (ie. is #HB_DIRECTION_INVALID),
 * it will be set to the natural horizontal direction of the
 * buffer script as returned by hb_script_get_horizontal_direction().
 * If hb_script_get_horizontal_direction() returns #HB_DIRECTION_INVALID,
 * then #HB_DIRECTION_LTR is used.
 *
 * Finally, if buffer language is not set (ie. is #HB_LANGUAGE_INVALID),
 * it will be set to the process&apos;s default language as returned by
 * hb_language_get_default().  This may change in the future by
 * taking buffer script into consideration when choosing a language.
 * Note that hb_language_get_default() is NOT threadsafe the first time
 * it is called.  See documentation for that function for details.
 *
 * Since: 0.9.7
