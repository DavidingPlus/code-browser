<doc f='qtbase-6.5.0/src/gui/painting/qpainter.cpp' l='1399'>\value VerticalSubpixelPositioning Allow text to be positioned at fractions
    of pixels vertically as well as horizontally, if this is supported by the
    font engine. This is currently supported by Freetype on all platforms when
    the hinting preference is QFont::PreferNoHinting, and also on macOS. For
    most use cases this will not improve visual quality, but may increase memory
    consumption and some reduction in text rendering performance. Therefore, enabling
    this is not recommended unless the use case requires it. One such use case could
    be aligning glyphs with other visual primitives.
    This value was added in Qt 6.1.</doc>
