    Returns \c true if this item collides with \a other; otherwise
    returns \c false.

    The \a mode is applied to \a other, and the resulting shape or
    bounding rectangle is then compared to this item&apos;s shape. The
    default value for \a mode is Qt::IntersectsItemShape; \a other
    collides with this item if it either intersects, contains, or is
    contained by this item&apos;s shape (see Qt::ItemSelectionMode for
    details).

    The default implementation is based on shape intersection, and it calls
    shape() on both items. Because the complexity of arbitrary shape-shape
    intersection grows with an order of magnitude when the shapes are complex,
    this operation can be noticeably time-consuming. You have the option of
    reimplementing this function in a subclass of QGraphicsItem to provide a
    custom algorithm. This allows you to make use of natural constraints in
    the shapes of your own items, in order to improve the performance of the
    collision detection. For instance, two untransformed perfectly circular
    items&apos; collision can be determined very efficiently by comparing their
    positions and radii.

    Keep in mind that when reimplementing this function and calling shape() or
    boundingRect() on \a other, the returned coordinates must be mapped to
    this item&apos;s coordinate system before any intersection can take place.
