   arguments specify a buffer of BUFLEN starting at BUF.  The last
   argument is a pointer to a variable which gets the value which
   would be stored in the global variable `herrno&apos; by the
   non-reentrant functions.

   These functions are not part of POSIX and therefore no official
   cancellation point.  But due to similarity with an POSIX interface
   or due to the implementation they are cancellation points and
   therefore not marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
