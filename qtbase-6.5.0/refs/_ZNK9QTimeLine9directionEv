    \property QTimeLine::direction
    \brief the direction of the timeline when QTimeLine is in \l Running
    state.

    This direction indicates whether the time moves from 0 towards the
    timeline duration, or from the value of the duration and towards 0 after
    start() has been called.

    Any binding of direction will be removed not only by setDirection(),
    but also by toggleDirection().

    By default, this property is set to \l Forward.
