    Moves the \a second widget around the ring of focus widgets so that
    keyboard focus moves from the \a first widget to the \a second widget when
    the Tab key is pressed.

    Note that since the tab order of the \a second widget is changed, you
    should order a chain like this:

    \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicswidget.cpp 1

    \e not like this:

    \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicswidget.cpp 2

    If \a first is \nullptr, this indicates that \a second should be the first widget
    to receive input focus should the scene gain Tab focus (i.e., the user
    hits Tab so that focus passes into the scene). If \a second is \nullptr, this
    indicates that \a first should be the first widget to gain focus if the
    scene gained BackTab focus.

    By default, tab order is defined implicitly using widget creation order.
