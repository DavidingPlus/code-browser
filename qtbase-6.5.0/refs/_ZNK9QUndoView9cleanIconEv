    \property QUndoView::cleanIcon
    \brief the icon used to represent the clean state.

    A stack may have a clean state set with QUndoStack::setClean(). This is usually
    the state of the document at the point it was saved. QUndoView can display an
    icon in the list of commands to show the clean state. If this property is
    a null icon, no icon is shown. The default value is the null icon.
