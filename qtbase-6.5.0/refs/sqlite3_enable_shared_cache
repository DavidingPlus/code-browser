** CAPI3REF: Enable Or Disable Shared Pager Cache
**
** ^(This routine enables or disables the sharing of the database cache
** and schema data structures between [database connection | connections]
** to the same database. Sharing is enabled if the argument is true
** and disabled if the argument is false.)^
**
** This interface is omitted if SQLite is compiled with
** [-DSQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE].  The [-DSQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE]
** compile-time option is recommended because the
** [use of shared cache mode is discouraged].
**
** ^Cache sharing is enabled and disabled for an entire process.
** This is a change as of SQLite [version 3.5.0] ([dateof:3.5.0]).
** In prior versions of SQLite,
** sharing was enabled or disabled for each thread separately.
**
** ^(The cache sharing mode set by this interface effects all subsequent
** calls to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()], and [sqlite3_open16()].
** Existing database connections continue to use the sharing mode
** that was in effect at the time they were opened.)^
**
** ^(This routine returns [SQLITE_OK] if shared cache was enabled or disabled
** successfully.  An [error code] is returned otherwise.)^
**
** ^Shared cache is disabled by default. It is recommended that it stay
** that way.  In other words, do not use this routine.  This interface
** continues to be provided for historical compatibility, but its use is
** discouraged.  Any use of shared cache is discouraged.  If shared cache
** must be used, it is recommended that shared cache only be enabled for
** individual database connections using the [sqlite3_open_v2()] interface
** with the [SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE] flag.
**
** Note: This method is disabled on MacOS X 10.7 and iOS version 5.0
** and will always return SQLITE_MISUSE. On those systems,
** shared cache mode should be enabled per-database connection via
** [sqlite3_open_v2()] with [SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE].
**
** This interface is threadsafe on processors where writing a
** 32-bit integer is atomic.
