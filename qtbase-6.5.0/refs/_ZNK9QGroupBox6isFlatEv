    \property QGroupBox::flat
    \brief whether the group box is painted flat or has a frame

    A group box usually consists of a surrounding frame with a title
    at the top. If this property is enabled, only the top part of the frame is
    drawn in most styles; otherwise, the whole frame is drawn.

    By default, this property is disabled, i.e., group boxes are not flat unless
    explicitly specified.

    \b{Note:} In some styles, flat and non-flat group boxes have similar
    representations and may not be as distinguishable as they are in other
    styles.
