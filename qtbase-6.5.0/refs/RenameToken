** Each RenameToken object maps an element of the parse tree into
** the token that generated that element.  The parse tree element
** might be one of:
**
**     *  A pointer to an Expr that represents an ID
**     *  The name of a table column in Column.zName
**
** A list of RenameToken objects can be constructed during parsing.
** Each new object is created by sqlite3RenameTokenMap().
** As the parse tree is transformed, the sqlite3RenameTokenRemap()
** routine is used to keep the mapping current.
**
** After the parse finishes, renameTokenFind() routine can be used
** to look up the actual token value that created some element in
** the parse tree.
