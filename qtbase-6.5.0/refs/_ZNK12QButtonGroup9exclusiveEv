    \property QButtonGroup::exclusive
    \brief whether the button group is exclusive

    If this property is \c true, then only one button in the group can be checked
    at any given time. The user can click on any button to check it, and that
    button will replace the existing one as the checked button in the group.

    In an exclusive group, the user cannot uncheck the currently checked button
    by clicking on it; instead, another button in the group must be clicked
    to set the new checked button for that group.

    By default, this property is \c true.
