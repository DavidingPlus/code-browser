    This event handler, for event \a wheelEvent, can be reimplemented in a
    subclass to receive mouse wheel events for the scene.

    By default, the event is delivered to the topmost visible item under the
    cursor. If ignored, the event propagates to the item beneath, and again
    until the event is accepted, or it reaches the scene. If no items accept
    the event, it is ignored.

    Note: See items() for a definition of which items are considered visible by this function.
