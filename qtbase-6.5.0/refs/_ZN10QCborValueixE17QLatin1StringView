    \overload

    Returns a QCborValueRef that can be used to read or modify the entry in
    this, as a map, with the given \a key. When this QCborValue is a QCborMap,
    this function is equivalent to the matching operator[] on that map.

    Before returning the reference: if this QCborValue was an array, it is first
    converted to a map (so that \c{map[i]} is \c{array[i]} for each index, \c i,
    with valid \c{array[i]}); otherwise, if it was not a map it will be
    over-written with an empty map.

    \sa operator[](qint64), QCborMap::operator[], QCborMap::value(),
        QCborMap::find()
