    Waits for at most \a msec milliseconds or until an incoming
    connection is available. Returns \c true if a connection is
    available; otherwise returns \c false. If the operation timed out
    and \a timedOut is not \nullptr, *\a timedOut will be set to true.

    This is a blocking function call. Its use is disadvised in a
    single-threaded GUI application, since the whole application will
    stop responding until the function returns.
    waitForNewConnection() is mostly useful when there is no event
    loop available.

    The non-blocking alternative is to connect to the newConnection()
    signal.

    If msec is -1, this function will not time out.
