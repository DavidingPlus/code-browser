    \internal
    Decompress the data internally and immediately discard the
    uncompressed data, but count how many bytes were decoded.
    This lets us know the final size, unfortunately at the cost of
    increased computation.

    To save on some of the computation we will store the data until
    we reach \c MaxDecompressedDataBufferSize stored. In this case the
    &quot;penalty&quot; is completely removed from users who read the data on
    readyRead rather than waiting for it all to be received. And
    any file smaller than \c MaxDecompressedDataBufferSize will
    avoid this issue as well.
