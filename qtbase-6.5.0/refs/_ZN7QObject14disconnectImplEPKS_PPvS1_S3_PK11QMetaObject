    \overload disconnect()
    \threadsafe

    Disconnects \a signal in object \a sender from \a method in object
    \a receiver. Returns \c true if the connection is successfully broken;
    otherwise returns \c false.

    A signal-slot connection is removed when either of the objects
    involved are destroyed.

    disconnect() is typically used in three ways, as the following
    examples demonstrate.
    \list 1
    \li Disconnect everything connected to an object&apos;s signals:

       \snippet code/src_corelib_kernel_qobject.cpp 26

    \li Disconnect everything connected to a specific signal:

       \snippet code/src_corelib_kernel_qobject.cpp 47

    \li Disconnect a specific receiver:

       \snippet code/src_corelib_kernel_qobject.cpp 30

    \li Disconnect a connection from one specific signal to a specific slot:

       \snippet code/src_corelib_kernel_qobject.cpp 48


    \endlist

    \nullptr may be used as a wildcard, meaning &quot;any signal&quot;, &quot;any receiving
    object&quot;, or &quot;any slot in the receiving object&quot;, respectively.

    The \a sender may never be \nullptr. (You cannot disconnect signals
    from more than one object in a single call.)

    If \a signal is \nullptr, it disconnects \a receiver and \a method from
    any signal. If not, only the specified signal is disconnected.

    If \a receiver is \nullptr, it disconnects anything connected to \a
    signal. If not, only slots in the specified receiver are disconnected.
    disconnect() with a non-null \a receiver also disconnects slot functions
    that were connected with \a receiver as their context object.

    If \a method is \nullptr, it disconnects anything that is connected to \a
    receiver. If not, only slots named \a method will be disconnected,
    and all other slots are left alone. The \a method must be \nullptr
    if \a receiver is left out, so you cannot disconnect a
    specifically-named slot on all objects.

    \note It is not possible to use this overload to disconnect signals
    connected to functors or lambda expressions. That is because it is not
    possible to compare them. Instead, use the overload that takes a
    QMetaObject::Connection
