    \fn void QNetworkAccessManager::finished(QNetworkReply *reply)

    This signal is emitted whenever a pending network reply is
    finished. The \a reply parameter will contain a pointer to the
    reply that has just finished. This signal is emitted in tandem
    with the QNetworkReply::finished() signal.

    See QNetworkReply::finished() for information on the status that
    the object will be in.

    \note Do not delete the \a reply object in the slot connected to this
    signal. Use deleteLater().

    \sa QNetworkReply::finished(), QNetworkReply::error()
