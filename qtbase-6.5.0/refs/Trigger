** Each trigger present in the database schema is stored as an instance of
** struct Trigger.
**
** Pointers to instances of struct Trigger are stored in two ways.
** 1. In the &quot;trigHash&quot; hash table (part of the sqlite3* that represents the
**    database). This allows Trigger structures to be retrieved by name.
** 2. All triggers associated with a single table form a linked list, using the
**    pNext member of struct Trigger. A pointer to the first element of the
**    linked list is stored as the &quot;pTrigger&quot; member of the associated
**    struct Table.
**
** The &quot;step_list&quot; member points to the first element of a linked list
** containing the SQL statements specified as the trigger program.
