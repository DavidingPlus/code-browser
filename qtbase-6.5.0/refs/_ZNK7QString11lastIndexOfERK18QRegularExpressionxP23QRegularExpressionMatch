    \since 5.5

    Returns the index position of the last match of the regular
    expression \a re in the string, which starts before the index
    position \a from.

    \include qstring.qdocinc negative-index-start-search-from-end

    Returns -1 if \a re didn&apos;t match anywhere.

    If the match is successful and \a rmatch is not \nullptr, it also
    writes the results of the match into the QRegularExpressionMatch object
    pointed to by \a rmatch.

    Example:

    \snippet qstring/main.cpp 94

    \note Due to how the regular expression matching algorithm works,
    this function will actually match repeatedly from the beginning of
    the string until the position \a from is reached.

    \note When searching for a regular expression \a re that may match
    0 characters, the match at the end of the data is excluded from the
    search by a negative \a from, even though \c{-1} is normally
    thought of as searching from the end of the string: the match at
    the end is \e after the last character, so it is excluded. To
    include such a final empty match, either give a positive value for
    \a from or omit the \a from parameter entirely.
