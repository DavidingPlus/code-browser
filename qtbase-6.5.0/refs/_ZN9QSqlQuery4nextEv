  Retrieves the next record in the result, if available, and positions
  the query on the retrieved record. Note that the result must be in
  the \l{isActive()}{active} state and isSelect() must return true
  before calling this function or it will do nothing and return false.

  The following rules apply:

  \list

  \li If the result is currently located before the first record,
  e.g. immediately after a query is executed, an attempt is made to
  retrieve the first record.

  \li If the result is currently located after the last record, there
  is no change and false is returned.

  \li If the result is located somewhere in the middle, an attempt is
  made to retrieve the next record.

  \endlist

  If the record could not be retrieved, the result is positioned after
  the last record and false is returned. If the record is successfully
  retrieved, true is returned.

  \sa previous(), first(), last(), seek(), at(), isActive(), isValid()
