    For windows, this is called from the QWidgetWindow::handleCloseEvent implementation,
    which QWidget::close indirectly calls by closing the QWindow. \a mode will be
    CloseWithEvent if QWidgetWindow::handleCloseEvent is called indirectly by
    QWindow::close, and CloseWithSpontaneousEvent if the close event originates from the
    system (i.e. the user clicked the close button in the title bar).

    QDialog calls this method directly in its hide() implementation, which might be
    called from the QDialog::closeEvent override. \a mode will be set to CloseNoEvent
    to prevent recursion.

    For non-windows, this is called directly by QWidget::close, and \a mode will be
    CloseWithEvent.

    The function is also called by the QWidget destructor, with \a mode set to CloseNoEvent.
