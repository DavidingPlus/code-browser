    \property QGuiApplication::desktopFileName
    \brief the base name of the desktop entry for this application
    \since 5.7

    This is the file name, without the full path, of the desktop entry
    that represents this application according to the freedesktop desktop
    entry specification.

    This property gives a precise indication of what desktop entry represents
    the application and it is needed by the windowing system to retrieve
    such information without resorting to imprecise heuristics.

    The latest version of the freedesktop desktop entry specification can be obtained
    \l{http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/}{here}.
