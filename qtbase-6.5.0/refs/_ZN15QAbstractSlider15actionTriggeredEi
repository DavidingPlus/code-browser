    \fn void QAbstractSlider::actionTriggered(int action)

    This signal is emitted when the slider action \a action is
    triggered. Actions are \l SliderSingleStepAdd, \l
    SliderSingleStepSub, \l SliderPageStepAdd, \l SliderPageStepSub,
    \l SliderToMinimum, \l SliderToMaximum, and \l SliderMove.

    When the signal is emitted, the \l sliderPosition has been
    adjusted according to the action, but the \l value has not yet
    been propagated (meaning the valueChanged() signal was not yet
    emitted), and the visual display has not been updated. In slots
    connected to this signal you can thus safely adjust any action by
    calling setSliderPosition() yourself, based on both the action and
    the slider&apos;s value.
