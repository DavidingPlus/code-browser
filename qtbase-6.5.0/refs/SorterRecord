** This object is the header on a single record while that record is being
** held in memory and prior to being written out as part of a PMA.
**
** How the linked list is connected depends on how memory is being managed
** by this module. If using a separate allocation for each in-memory record
** (VdbeSorter.list.aMemory==0), then the list is always connected using the
** SorterRecord.u.pNext pointers.
**
** Or, if using the single large allocation method (VdbeSorter.list.aMemory!=0),
** then while records are being accumulated the list is linked using the
** SorterRecord.u.iNext offset. This is because the aMemory[] array may
** be sqlite3Realloc()ed while records are being accumulated. Once the VM
** has finished passing records to the sorter, or when the in-memory buffer
** is full, the list is sorted. As part of the sorting process, it is
** converted to use the SorterRecord.u.pNext pointers. See function
** vdbeSorterSort() for details.
