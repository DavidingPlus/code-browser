    \fn void QMenuBar::triggered(QAction *action)

    This signal is emitted when an action in a menu belonging to this menubar
    is triggered as a result of a mouse click; \a action is the action that
    caused the signal to be emitted.

    \note QMenuBar has to have ownership of the QMenu in order this signal to work.

    Normally, you connect each menu action to a single slot using
    QAction::triggered(), but sometimes you will want to connect
    several items to a single slot (most often if the user selects
    from an array). This signal is useful in such cases.

    \sa hovered(), QAction::triggered()
