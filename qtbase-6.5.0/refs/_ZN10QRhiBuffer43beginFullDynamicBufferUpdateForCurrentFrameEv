    \return a pointer to a memory block with the host visible buffer data.

    This is a shortcut for medium-to-large dynamic uniform buffers that have
    their \b entire contents (or at least all regions that are read by the
    shaders in the current frame) changed \b{in every frame} and the
    QRhiResourceUpdateBatch-based update mechanism is seen too heavy due to the
    amount of data copying involved.

    The call to this function must be eventually followed by a call to
    endFullDynamicUniformBufferUpdateForCurrentFrame(), before recording any
    render or compute pass that relies on this buffer.

    \warning Updating data via this method is not compatible with
    QRhiResourceUpdateBatch-based updates and readbacks. Unexpected behavior
    may occur when attempting to combine the two update models for the same
    buffer. Similarly, the data updated this direct way may not be visible to
    \l{QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::readBackBuffer()}{readBackBuffer operations},
    depending on the backend.

    \warning When updating buffer data via this method, the update must be done
    in every frame, otherwise backends that perform double or triple buffering
    of resources may end up in unexpected behavior.

    \warning Partial updates are not possible with this approach since some
    backends may choose a strategy where the previous contents of the buffer is
    lost upon calling this function. Data must be written to all regions that
    are read by shaders in the frame currently being prepared.

    \warning This function can only be called when recording a frame, so
    between QRhi::beginFrame() and QRhi::endFrame().

    \warning This function can only be called on Dynamic buffers.
