** NOTES ON TRANSACTIONS:
**
** SQLite invokes the following virtual table methods as transactions are
** opened and closed by the user:
**
**     xBegin():    Start of a new transaction.
**     xSync():     Initial part of two-phase commit.
**     xCommit():   Final part of two-phase commit.
**     xRollback(): Rollback the transaction.
**
** Anything that is required as part of a commit that may fail is performed
** in the xSync() callback. Current versions of SQLite ignore any errors
** returned by xCommit().
**
** And as sub-transactions are opened/closed:
**
**     xSavepoint(int S):  Open savepoint S.
**     xRelease(int S):    Commit and close savepoint S.
**     xRollbackTo(int S): Rollback to start of savepoint S.
**
** During a write-transaction the fts5_index.c module may cache some data
** in-memory. It is flushed to disk whenever xSync(), xRelease() or
** xSavepoint() is called. And discarded whenever xRollback() or xRollbackTo()
** is called.
**
** Additionally, if SQLITE_DEBUG is defined, an instance of the following
** structure is used to record the current transaction state. This information
** is not required, but it is used in the assert() statements executed by
** function fts5CheckTransactionState() (see below).
