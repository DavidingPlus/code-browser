    Returns whether this address is eligible for publication in the Domain Name
    System (DNS) or similar name resolution mechanisms.

    In general, an address is suitable for publication if it is an address this
    machine will be reached at for an indeterminate amount of time, though it
    need not be permanent. For example, addresses obtained via DHCP are often
    eligible, but cryptographically-generated temporary IPv6 addresses are not.

    On some systems, QNetworkInterface will need to heuristically determine
    which addresses are eligible.
