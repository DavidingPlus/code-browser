  \property QTreeView::indentation
  \brief indentation of the items in the tree view.

  This property holds the indentation measured in pixels of the items for each
  level in the tree view. For top-level items, the indentation specifies the
  horizontal distance from the viewport edge to the items in the first column;
  for child items, it specifies their indentation from their parent items.

  By default, the value of this property is style dependent. Thus, when the style
  changes, this property updates from it. Calling setIndentation() stops the updates,
  calling resetIndentation() will restore default behavior.
