   * @function:
   *   FT_Attach_Stream
   *
   * @description:
   *   &apos;Attach&apos; data to a face object.  Normally, this is used to read
   *   additional information for the face object.  For example, you can
   *   attach an AFM file that comes with a Type~1 font to get the kerning
   *   values and other metrics.
   *
   * @inout:
   *   face ::
   *     The target face object.
   *
   * @input:
   *   parameters ::
   *     A pointer to @FT_Open_Args that must be filled by the caller.
   *
   * @return:
   *   FreeType error code.  0~means success.
   *
   * @note:
   *   The meaning of the &apos;attach&apos; (i.e., what really happens when the new
   *   file is read) is not fixed by FreeType itself.  It really depends on
   *   the font format (and thus the font driver).
   *
   *   Client applications are expected to know what they are doing when
   *   invoking this function.  Most drivers simply do not implement file or
   *   stream attachments.
