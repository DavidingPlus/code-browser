  Instruct the database driver that no more data will be fetched from
  this query until it is re-executed. There is normally no need to
  call this function, but it may be helpful in order to free resources
  such as locks or cursors if you intend to re-use the query at a
  later time.

  Sets the query to inactive. Bound values retain their values.
