    \fn int QThread::idealThreadCount()

    Returns the ideal number of threads that this process can run in parallel.
    This is done by querying the number of logical processors available to this
    process (if supported by this OS) or the total number of logical processors
    in the system. This function returns 1 if neither value could be
    determined.

    \note On operating systems that support setting a thread&apos;s affinity to a
    subset of all logical processors, the value returned by this function may
    change between threads and over time.

    \note On operating systems that support CPU hotplugging and hot-unplugging,
    the value returned by this function may also change over time (and note
    that CPUs can be turned on and off by software, without a physical,
    hardware change).
