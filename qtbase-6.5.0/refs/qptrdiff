    \typedef qptrdiff
    \relates &lt;QtTypes&gt;

    Integral type for representing pointer differences.

    Typedef for either qint32 or qint64. This type is guaranteed to be
    the same size as a pointer on all platforms supported by Qt. On a
    system with 32-bit pointers, quintptr is a typedef for quint32; on
    a system with 64-bit pointers, quintptr is a typedef for quint64.

    Note that qptrdiff is signed. Use quintptr for unsigned values.

    In order to print values of this type by using formatted-output
    facilities such as \c{printf()}, qDebug(), QString::asprintf() and
    so on, you can use the \c{PRIdQPTRDIFF} and \c{PRIiQPTRDIFF}
    macros as format specifiers. They will both print the value as a
    base 10 number.

    \code
    qptrdiff d = 123;
    printf(&quot;The difference is %&quot; PRIdQPTRDIFF &quot;\n&quot;, d);
    \endcode

    \sa quintptr, qint32, qint64
