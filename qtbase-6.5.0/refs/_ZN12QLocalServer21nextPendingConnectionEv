    Returns the next pending connection as a connected QLocalSocket object.

    The socket is created as a child of the server, which means that it is
    automatically deleted when the QLocalServer object is destroyed. It is
    still a good idea to delete the object explicitly when you are done with
    it, to avoid wasting memory.

    \nullptr is returned if this function is called when there are no pending
    connections.
