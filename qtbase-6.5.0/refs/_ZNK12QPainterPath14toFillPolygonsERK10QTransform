    Converts the path into a list of polygons using the
    QTransform \a matrix, and returns the list.

    The function differs from the toFillPolygon() function in that it
    creates several polygons. It is provided because it is usually
    faster to draw several small polygons than to draw one large
    polygon, even though the total number of points drawn is the same.

    The toFillPolygons() function differs from the toSubpathPolygons()
    function in that it create only polygon for subpaths that have
    overlapping bounding rectangles.

    Like the toFillPolygon() function, this function uses a rewinding
    technique to make sure that overlapping subpaths can be filled
    using the correct fill rule. Note that rewinding inserts addition
    lines in the polygons so the outline of the fill polygon does not
    match the outline of the path.
