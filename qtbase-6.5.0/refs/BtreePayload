** entry in either an index or table btree.
**
** Index btrees (used for indexes and also WITHOUT ROWID tables) contain
** an arbitrary key and no data.  These btrees have pKey,nKey set to the
** key and the pData,nData,nZero fields are uninitialized.  The aMem,nMem
** fields give an array of Mem objects that are a decomposition of the key.
** The nMem field might be zero, indicating that no decomposition is available.
**
** Table btrees (used for rowid tables) contain an integer rowid used as
** the key and passed in the nKey field.  The pKey field is zero.
** pData,nData hold the content of the new entry.  nZero extra zero bytes
** are appended to the end of the content when constructing the entry.
** The aMem,nMem fields are uninitialized for table btrees.
**
** Field usage summary:
**
**               Table BTrees                   Index Btrees
**
**   pKey        always NULL                    encoded key
**   nKey        the ROWID                      length of pKey
**   pData       data                           not used
**   aMem        not used                       decomposed key value
**   nMem        not used                       entries in aMem
**   nData       length of pData                not used
**   nZero       extra zeros after pData        not used
**
** This object is used to pass information into sqlite3BtreeInsert().  The
** same information used to be passed as five separate parameters.  But placing
** the information into this object helps to keep the interface more
** organized and understandable, and it also helps the resulting code to
** run a little faster by using fewer registers for parameter passing.
