       *  @brief Attempts to insert a std::pair into the %map.
       *  @param __x Pair to be inserted (see std::make_pair for easy
       *	     creation of pairs).
       *
       *  @return  A pair, of which the first element is an iterator that
       *           points to the possibly inserted pair, and the second is
       *           a bool that is true if the pair was actually inserted.
       *
       *  This function attempts to insert a (key, value) %pair into the %map.
       *  A %map relies on unique keys and thus a %pair is only inserted if its
       *  first element (the key) is not already present in the %map.
       *
       *  Insertion requires logarithmic time.
