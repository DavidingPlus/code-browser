** CAPI3REF: Prepared Statement Status
** METHOD: sqlite3_stmt
**
** ^(Each prepared statement maintains various
** [SQLITE_STMTSTATUS counters] that measure the number
** of times it has performed specific operations.)^  These counters can
** be used to monitor the performance characteristics of the prepared
** statements.  For example, if the number of table steps greatly exceeds
** the number of table searches or result rows, that would tend to indicate
** that the prepared statement is using a full table scan rather than
** an index.
**
** ^(This interface is used to retrieve and reset counter values from
** a [prepared statement].  The first argument is the prepared statement
** object to be interrogated.  The second argument
** is an integer code for a specific [SQLITE_STMTSTATUS counter]
** to be interrogated.)^
** ^The current value of the requested counter is returned.
** ^If the resetFlg is true, then the counter is reset to zero after this
** interface call returns.
