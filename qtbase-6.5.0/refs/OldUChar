 * \var OldUChar
 * Default ICU 58 definition of UChar.
 * A base type for UTF-16 code units and pointers.
 * Unsigned 16-bit integer.
 *
 * Define OldUChar to be wchar_t if that is 16 bits wide.
 * If wchar_t is not 16 bits wide, then define UChar to be uint16_t.
 *
 * This makes the definition of OldUChar platform-dependent
 * but allows direct string type compatibility with platforms with
 * 16-bit wchar_t types.
 *
 * This is how UChar was defined in ICU 58, for transition convenience.
 * Exception: ICU 58 UChar was defined to UCHAR_TYPE if that macro was defined.
 * The current UChar responds to UCHAR_TYPE but OldUChar does not.
 *
