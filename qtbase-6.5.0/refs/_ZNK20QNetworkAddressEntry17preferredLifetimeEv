    Returns the deadline when this address becomes deprecated (no longer
    preferred), if known. If the address lifetime is not known (see
    isLifetimeKnown()), this function always returns QDeadlineTimer::Forever.

    While an address is preferred, it may be used by the operating system as
    the source address for new, outgoing packets. After it becomes deprecated,
    it will remain valid for incoming packets for a while longer until finally
    removed (see validityLifetime()).
