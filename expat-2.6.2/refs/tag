<doc f='expat-2.6.2/lib/xmlparse.c' l='293'>/* TAG represents an open element.
   The name of the element is stored in both the document and API
   encodings.  The memory buffer &apos;buf&apos; is a separately-allocated
   memory area which stores the name.  During the XML_Parse()/
   XMLParseBuffer() when the element is open, the memory for the &apos;raw&apos;
   version of the name (in the document encoding) is shared with the
   document buffer.  If the element is open across calls to
   XML_Parse()/XML_ParseBuffer(), the buffer is re-allocated to
   contain the &apos;raw&apos; name as well.

   A parser reuses these structures, maintaining a list of allocated
   TAG objects in a free list.
