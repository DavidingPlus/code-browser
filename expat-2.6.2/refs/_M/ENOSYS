 * This error code is special: arch syscall entry code will return
 * -ENOSYS if users try to call a syscall that doesn&apos;t exist.  To keep
 * failures of syscalls that really do exist distinguishable from
 * failures due to attempts to use a nonexistent syscall, syscall
 * implementations should refrain from returning -ENOSYS.
