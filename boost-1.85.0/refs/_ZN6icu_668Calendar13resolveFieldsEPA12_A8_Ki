     * Given a precedence table, return the newest field combination in
     * the table, or UCAL_FIELD_COUNT if none is found.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;The precedence table is a 3-dimensional array of integers.  It
     * may be thought of as an array of groups.  Each group is an array of
     * lines.  Each line is an array of field numbers.  Within a line, if
     * all fields are set, then the time stamp of the line is taken to be
     * the stamp of the most recently set field.  If any field of a line is
     * unset, then the line fails to match.  Within a group, the line with
     * the newest time stamp is selected.  The first field of the line is
     * returned to indicate which line matched.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;In some cases, it may be desirable to map a line to field that
     * whose stamp is NOT examined.  For example, if the best field is
     * DAY_OF_WEEK then the DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH algorithm may be used.  In
     * order to do this, insert the value &lt;code&gt;kResolveRemap | F&lt;/code&gt; at
     * the start of the line, where &lt;code&gt;F&lt;/code&gt; is the desired return
     * field value.  This field will NOT be examined; it only determines
     * the return value if the other fields in the line are the newest.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;If all lines of a group contain at least one unset field, then no
     * line will match, and the group as a whole will fail to match.  In
     * that case, the next group will be processed.  If all groups fail to
     * match, then UCAL_FIELD_COUNT is returned.
