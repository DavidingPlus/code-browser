   * Return the previous character in the normalized text and decrement.
   * (Pre-decrement semantics.)
   * If the beginning of the text has already been reached, DONE is returned.
   * The DONE value could be confused with a U+FFFF non-character code point
   * in the text. If this is possible, you can test
   * (getIndex()&gt;startIndex() || first()!=DONE). (Calling first() will change
   * the iterator state!)
   *
   * The C API unorm_previous() is more efficient and does not have this ambiguity.
   *
   * @return the previous normalized code point
   * @deprecated ICU 56 Use Normalizer2 instead.
