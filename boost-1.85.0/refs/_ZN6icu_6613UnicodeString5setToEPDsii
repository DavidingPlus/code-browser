   * Aliasing setTo() function, analogous to the writable-aliasing char16_t* constructor.
   * The text will be used for the UnicodeString object, but
   * it will not be released when the UnicodeString is destroyed.
   * This has write-through semantics:
   * For as long as the capacity of the buffer is sufficient, write operations
   * will directly affect the buffer. When more capacity is necessary, then
   * a new buffer will be allocated and the contents copied as with regularly
   * constructed strings.
   * In an assignment to another UnicodeString, the buffer will be copied.
   * The extract(Char16Ptr dst) function detects whether the dst pointer is the same
   * as the string buffer itself and will in this case not copy the contents.
   *
   * @param buffer The characters to alias for the UnicodeString.
   * @param buffLength The number of Unicode characters in `buffer` to alias.
   * @param buffCapacity The size of `buffer` in char16_ts.
   * @return a reference to this
   * @stable ICU 2.0
