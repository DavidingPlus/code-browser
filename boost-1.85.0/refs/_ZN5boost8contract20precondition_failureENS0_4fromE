Call failure handler for preconditions.

This is often called only internally by this library.

@b Throws:  This can throw in case programmers specify a failure handler that
            throws exceptions on contract assertion failures (not the default).

@param where    Operation that failed the contract assertion (when this function
                is called by this library, this parameter will never be
                @c from_destructor because destructors do not have
                preconditions).
