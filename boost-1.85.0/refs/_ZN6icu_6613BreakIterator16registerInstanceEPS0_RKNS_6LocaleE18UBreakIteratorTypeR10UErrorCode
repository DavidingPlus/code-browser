     * Register a new break iterator of the indicated kind, to use in the given locale.
     * The break iterator will be adopted.  Clones of the iterator will be returned
     * if a request for a break iterator of the given kind matches or falls back to
     * this locale.
     * Because ICU may choose to cache BreakIterators internally, this must
     * be called at application startup, prior to any calls to
     * BreakIterator::createXXXInstance to avoid undefined behavior.
     * @param toAdopt the BreakIterator instance to be adopted
     * @param locale the Locale for which this instance is to be registered
     * @param kind the type of iterator for which this instance is to be registered
     * @param status the in/out status code, no special meanings are assigned
     * @return a registry key that can be used to unregister this instance
