   * This constructor is typically used to perform name resolution for local
   * service binding.
   *
   * @param service A string identifying the requested service. This may be a
   * descriptive name or a numeric string corresponding to a port number.
   *
   * @param resolve_flags A set of flags that determine how name resolution
   * should be performed. The default flags are suitable for local service
   * binding.
   *
   * @note On POSIX systems, service names are typically defined in the file
   * &lt;tt&gt;/etc/services&lt;/tt&gt;. On Windows, service names may be found in the file
   * &lt;tt&gt;c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\services&lt;/tt&gt;. Operating systems
   * may use additional locations when resolving service names.
