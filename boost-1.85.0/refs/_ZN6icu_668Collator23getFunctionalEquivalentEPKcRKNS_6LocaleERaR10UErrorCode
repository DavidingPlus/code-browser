     * Return the functionally equivalent locale for the given
     * requested locale, with respect to given keyword, for the
     * collation service.  If two locales return the same result, then
     * collators instantiated for these locales will behave
     * equivalently.  The converse is not always true; two collators
     * may in fact be equivalent, but return different results, due to
     * internal details.  The return result has no other meaning than
     * that stated above, and implies nothing as to the relationship
     * between the two locales.  This is intended for use by
     * applications who wish to cache collators, or otherwise reuse
     * collators when possible.  The functional equivalent may change
     * over time.  For more information, please see the &lt;a
     * href=&quot;http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale#TOC-Locales-and-Services&quot;&gt;
     * Locales and Services&lt;/a&gt; section of the ICU User Guide.
     * @param keyword a particular keyword as enumerated by
     * ucol_getKeywords.
     * @param locale the requested locale
     * @param isAvailable reference to a fillin parameter that
     * indicates whether the requested locale was &apos;available&apos; to the
     * collation service. A locale is defined as &apos;available&apos; if it
     * physically exists within the collation locale data.
     * @param status reference to input-output error code
     * @return the functionally equivalent collation locale, or the root
     * locale upon error.
