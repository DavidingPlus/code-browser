     * Return the week number of a day, within a period. This may be the week number in
     * a year or the week number in a month. Usually this will be a value &gt;= 1, but if
     * some initial days of the period are excluded from week 1, because
     * {@link #getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek} is &gt; 1, then
     * the week number will be zero for those
     * initial days. This method requires the day number and day of week for some
     * known date in the period in order to determine the day of week
     * on the desired day.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * &lt;b&gt;Subclassing:&lt;/b&gt;
     * &lt;br&gt;
     * This method is intended for use by subclasses in implementing their
     * {@link #computeTime computeTime} and/or {@link #computeFields computeFields} methods.
     * It is often useful in {@link #getActualMinimum getActualMinimum} and
     * {@link #getActualMaximum getActualMaximum} as well.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This variant is handy for computing the week number of some other
     * day of a period (often the first or last day of the period) when its day
     * of the week is not known but the day number and day of week for some other
     * day in the period (e.g. the current date) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; known.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * @param desiredDay    The {@link #UCalendarDateFields DAY_OF_YEAR} or
     *              {@link #UCalendarDateFields DAY_OF_MONTH} whose week number is desired.
     *              Should be 1 for the first day of the period.
     *
     * @param dayOfPeriod   The {@link #UCalendarDateFields DAY_OF_YEAR}
     *              or {@link #UCalendarDateFields DAY_OF_MONTH} for a day in the period whose
     *              {@link #UCalendarDateFields DAY_OF_WEEK} is specified by the
     *              &lt;code&gt;knownDayOfWeek&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
     *              Should be 1 for first day of period.
     *
     * @param dayOfWeek  The {@link #UCalendarDateFields DAY_OF_WEEK} for the day
     *              corresponding to the &lt;code&gt;knownDayOfPeriod&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
     *              1-based with 1=Sunday.
     *
     * @return      The week number (one-based), or zero if the day falls before
     *              the first week because
     *              {@link #getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek}
     *              is more than one.
