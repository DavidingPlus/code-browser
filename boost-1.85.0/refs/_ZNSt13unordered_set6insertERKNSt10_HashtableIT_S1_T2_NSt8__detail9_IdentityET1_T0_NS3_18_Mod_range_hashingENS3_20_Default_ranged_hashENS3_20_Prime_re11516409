       *  @brief Attempts to insert an element into the %unordered_set.
       *  @param  __x  Element to be inserted.
       *  @return  A pair, of which the first element is an iterator that points
       *           to the possibly inserted element, and the second is a bool
       *           that is true if the element was actually inserted.
       *
       *  This function attempts to insert an element into the %unordered_set.
       *  An %unordered_set relies on unique keys and thus an element is only
       *  inserted if it is not already present in the %unordered_set.
       *
       *  Insertion requires amortized constant time.
