 * \brief A class of an attribute that holds stack of named scopes of the current thread
 *
 * The basic_named_scope attribute is essentially a hook to the thread-specific instance of
 * scope list. This means that the attribute will generate different values if get_value is
 * called in different threads. The attribute generates value with stored type
 * &lt;tt&gt;basic_named_scope_list&lt; CharT &gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.
 *
 * The attribute class can also be used to gain access to the scope stack instance, e.g. to
 * get its copy or to push or pop a scope entry. However, it is highly not recommended to
 * maintain scope list manually. Use \c BOOST_LOG_NAMED_SCOPE or \c BOOST_LOG_FUNCTION macros instead.
