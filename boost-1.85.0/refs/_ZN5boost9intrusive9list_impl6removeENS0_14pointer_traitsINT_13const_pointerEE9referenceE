   //!   No destructors are called.
   //!
   //! &lt;b&gt;Throws&lt;/b&gt;: If operator == throws. Basic guarantee.
   //!
   //! &lt;b&gt;Complexity&lt;/b&gt;: Linear time. It performs exactly size() comparisons for equality.
   //!
   //! &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The relative order of elements that are not removed is unchanged,
   //!   and iterators to elements that are not removed remain valid.</doc>
