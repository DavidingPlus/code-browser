     * &quot;Fast C or D&quot; form.
     * If a string is in this form, then further decomposition &lt;i&gt;without reordering&lt;/i&gt;
     * would yield the same form as DECOMPOSE.
     * Text in &quot;Fast C or D&quot; form can be processed efficiently with data tables
     * that are &quot;canonically closed&quot;, that is, that provide equivalent data for
     * equivalent text, without having to be fully normalized.
     * Not a standard Unicode normalization form.
     * Not a unique form: Different FCD strings can be canonically equivalent.
     * For details see http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn5/#FCD
