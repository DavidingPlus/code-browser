     * Performs scanning of the target directory for log files that may have been left from
     * previous runs of the application. The found files are considered by the file collector
     * as if they were rotated.
     *
     * The file scan can be performed in two ways: either all files in the target directory will
     * be considered as log files, or only those files that satisfy the target file name pattern.
     * See documentation on &lt;tt&gt;sinks::file::collector::scan_for_files&lt;/tt&gt; for more information.
     *
     * \pre File collector and the proper file name pattern have already been set.
     *
     * \param method File scanning method
     * \param update_counter If \c true and \a method is \c scan_matching, the method attempts
     *        to update the internal file counter according to the found files. The counter
     *        is unaffected otherwise.
     * \return The number of files found.
     *
     * \note The method essentially delegates to the same-named function of the file collector.
