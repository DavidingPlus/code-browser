        // Node modification
    
        //! Sets name of node to a non zero-terminated string.
        //! See \ref ownership_of_strings.
        //! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        //! Note that node does not own its name or value, it only stores a pointer to it. 
        //! It will not delete or otherwise free the pointer on destruction.
        //! It is responsibility of the user to properly manage lifetime of the string.
        //! The easiest way to achieve it is to use memory_pool of the document to allocate the string -
        //! on destruction of the document the string will be automatically freed.
        //! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        //! Size of name must be specified separately, because name does not have to be zero terminated.
        //! Use name(const Ch *) function to have the length automatically calculated (string must be zero terminated).
        //! \param n Name of node to set. Does not have to be zero terminated.
        //! \param size Size of name, in characters. This does not include zero terminator, if one is present.</doc>
