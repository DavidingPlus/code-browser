<doc f='boost-1.85.0/libs/serialization/include/boost/serialization/tracking.hpp' l='89'>// The STATIC_ASSERT is prevents one from setting tracking for a primitive type.
// This almost HAS to be an error.  Doing this will effect serialization of all
// char&apos;s in your program which is almost certainly what you don&apos;t want to do.
// If you want to track all instances of a given primitive type, You&apos;ll have to
// wrap it in your own type so its not a primitive anymore.  Then it will compile
// without problem.</doc>
