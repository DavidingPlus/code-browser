 * Get a code point from a string at a code point boundary offset,
 * and advance the offset to the next code point boundary.
 * (Post-incrementing forward iteration.)
 * &quot;Safe&quot; macro, checks for illegal sequences and for string boundaries.
 *
 * The length can be negative for a NUL-terminated string.
 *
 * The offset may point to the lead byte of a multi-byte sequence,
 * in which case the macro will read the whole sequence.
 * If the offset points to a trail byte or an illegal UTF-8 sequence, then
 * c is set to U+FFFD.
 *
 * This macro does not distinguish between a real U+FFFD in the text
 * and U+FFFD returned for an ill-formed sequence.
 * Use U8_NEXT() if that distinction is important.
 *
 * @param s const uint8_t * string
 * @param i int32_t string offset, must be i&lt;length
 * @param length int32_t string length
 * @param c output UChar32 variable, set to U+FFFD in case of an error
 * @see U8_NEXT
 * @stable ICU 51
