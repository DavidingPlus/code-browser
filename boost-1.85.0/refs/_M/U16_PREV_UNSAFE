 * Move the string offset from one code point boundary to the previous one
 * and get the code point between them.
 * (Pre-decrementing backward iteration.)
 * &quot;Unsafe&quot; macro, assumes well-formed UTF-16.
 *
 * The input offset may be the same as the string length.
 * If the offset is behind a trail surrogate unit
 * for a supplementary code point, then the macro will read
 * the preceding lead surrogate as well.
 * If the offset is behind a lead surrogate, then that itself
 * will be returned as the code point.
 * The result is undefined if the offset is behind a single, unpaired trail surrogate.
 *
 * @param s const UChar * string
 * @param i string offset
 * @param c output UChar32 variable
 * @see U16_PREV
