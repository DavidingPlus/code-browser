//  BOOST_LIB_VERSION must be defined to be the same as BOOST_VERSION
//  but as a *string* in the form &quot;x_y[_z]&quot; where x is the major version
//  number, y is the minor version number, and z is the patch level if not 0.
//  This is used by &lt;config/auto_link.hpp&gt; to select which library version to link to.</doc>
