 * Option value for case folding:
 *
 * Use the modified set of mappings provided in CaseFolding.txt to handle dotted I
 * and dotless i appropriately for Turkic languages (tr, az).
 *
 * Before Unicode 3.2, CaseFolding.txt contains mappings marked with &apos;I&apos; that
 * are to be included for default mappings and
 * excluded for the Turkic-specific mappings.
 *
 * Unicode 3.2 CaseFolding.txt instead contains mappings marked with &apos;T&apos; that
 * are to be excluded for default mappings and
 * included for the Turkic-specific mappings.

 * @stable ICU 2.0
