 * Calculates the size of a buffer for conversion from Unicode to a charset.
 * The calculated size is guaranteed to be sufficient for this conversion.
 *
 * It takes into account initial and final non-character bytes that are output
 * by some converters.
 * It does not take into account callbacks which output more than one charset
 * character sequence per call, like escape callbacks.
 * The default (substitution) callback only outputs one charset character sequence.
 *
 * @param length Number of UChars to be converted.
 * @param maxCharSize Return value from ucnv_getMaxCharSize() for the converter
 *                    that will be used.
 * @return Size of a buffer that will be large enough to hold the output bytes of
 *         converting length UChars with the converter that returned the maxCharSize.
