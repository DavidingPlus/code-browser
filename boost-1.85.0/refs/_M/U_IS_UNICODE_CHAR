 * Is c a Unicode code point value (0..U+10ffff)
 * that can be assigned a character?
 *
 * Code points that are not characters include:
 * - single surrogate code points (U+d800..U+dfff, 2048 code points)
 * - the last two code points on each plane (U+__fffe and U+__ffff, 34 code points)
 * - U+fdd0..U+fdef (new with Unicode 3.1, 32 code points)
 * - the highest Unicode code point value is U+10ffff
 *
 * This means that all code points below U+d800 are character code points,
 * and that boundary is tested first for performance.
 *
 * @param c 32-bit code point
 * @return TRUE or FALSE
 * @stable ICU 2.4
