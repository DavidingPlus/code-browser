   //!This macro is used to achieve portable optimal move constructors.
   //!
   //!In C++03 mode, when accessing a member of type through a rvalue (implemented as a `rv&lt;T&gt; &amp;` type, where rv&lt;T&gt; derives
   //!from T) triggers a potential UB as the program never creates objects of type rv&lt;T&gt;. This macro casts back `rv&lt;T&gt;` to
   //!`T&amp;` so that access to member types are done through the original type.
   //! 
   //!In C++11 compilers the cast from a rvalue reference of a derived type to a rvalue reference of
   //!a base type is implicit, so it&apos;s a no-op.</doc>
