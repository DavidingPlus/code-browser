 * Move the string offset from one code point boundary to the previous one
 * and get the code point between them.
 * (Pre-decrementing backward iteration.)
 * &quot;Safe&quot; macro, handles unpaired surrogates and checks for string boundaries.
 *
 * The input offset may be the same as the string length.
 * If the offset is behind a trail surrogate unit
 * for a supplementary code point, then the macro will read
 * the preceding lead surrogate as well.
 * If the offset is behind a lead surrogate or behind a single, unpaired
 * trail surrogate, then c is set to that unpaired surrogate.
 *
 * @param s const UChar * string
 * @param start starting string offset (usually 0)
 * @param i string offset, must be start&lt;i
 * @param c output UChar32 variable
 * @see U16_PREV_UNSAFE
 * @stable ICU 2.4
