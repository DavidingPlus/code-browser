   that they are supported by overriding __SIGRTMAX to a value greater
   than __SIGRTMIN.  These constants give the kernel-level hard limits,
   but some real-time signals may be used internally by glibc.  Do not
   use these constants in application code; use SIGRTMIN and SIGRTMAX
   (defined in signal.h) instead.  */</doc>
