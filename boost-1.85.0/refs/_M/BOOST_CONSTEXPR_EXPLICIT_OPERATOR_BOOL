 * \brief The macro defines a constexpr explicit operator of conversion to \c bool
 *
 * The macro should be used inside the definition of a class that has to
 * support the conversion. The class should also implement &lt;tt&gt;operator!&lt;/tt&gt;,
 * in terms of which the conversion operator will be implemented.
