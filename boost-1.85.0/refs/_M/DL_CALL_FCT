   the function found using `dlsym&apos; using the following macro since
   these calls do not use the PLT.  But this would mean the dynamic
   loader has no chance to find out when the function is called.  The
   macro applies the necessary magic so that profiling is possible.
   Rewrite
	foo = (*fctp) (arg1, arg2);
   into
        foo = DL_CALL_FCT (fctp, (arg1, arg2));
