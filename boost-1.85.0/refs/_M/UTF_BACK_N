 * Move i backward (towards the beginning of the string)
 * to the first code unit of the n code points that have code units before i.
 * I.e., move i backward by n code points.
 * i must point to the first code unit after the last unit of a code point (i==length is allowed).
 * Same as UTF16_BACK_N.
