<doc f='boost-1.85.0/libs/asio/include/boost/asio/detail/concurrency_hint.hpp' l='49'>// This special concurrency hint disables locking in both the scheduler and
// reactor I/O. This hint has the following restrictions:
//
// - Care must be taken to ensure that all operations on the io_context and any
//   of its associated I/O objects (such as sockets and timers) occur in only
//   one thread at a time.
//
// - Asynchronous resolve operations fail with operation_not_supported.
//
// - If a signal_set is used with the io_context, signal_set objects cannot be
//   used with any other io_context in the program.</doc>
