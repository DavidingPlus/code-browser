 * Get a code point from a string at a code point boundary offset,
 * and advance the offset to the next code point boundary.
 * (Post-incrementing forward iteration.)
 * &quot;Unsafe&quot; macro, assumes well-formed UTF-16.
 *
 * The offset may point to the lead surrogate unit
 * for a supplementary code point, in which case the macro will read
 * the following trail surrogate as well.
 * If the offset points to a trail surrogate, then that itself
 * will be returned as the code point.
 * The result is undefined if the offset points to a single, unpaired lead surrogate.

 * @param s const UChar * string
 * @param i string offset
 * @param c output UChar32 variable
