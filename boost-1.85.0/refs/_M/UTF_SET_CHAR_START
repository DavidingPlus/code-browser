 * Take the random-access index i and adjust it so that it points to the beginning
 * of a code point.
 * The input index points to any code unit of a code point and is moved to point to
 * the first code unit of the same code point. i is never incremented.
 * In other words, if i points to a trail surrogate that is preceded by a matching
 * lead surrogate, then i is decremented. Otherwise it is not modified.
 * This can be used to start an iteration with UTF_NEXT_CHAR() from a random index.
 * Same as UTF16_SET_CHAR_START.
 * \pre start&lt;=i&lt;length
 * \post start&lt;=i&lt;length
 *
 * @deprecated ICU 2.4. Renamed to U16_SET_CP_START, see utf_old.h.
