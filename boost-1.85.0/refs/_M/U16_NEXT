 * Get a code point from a string at a code point boundary offset,
 * and advance the offset to the next code point boundary.
 * (Post-incrementing forward iteration.)
 * &quot;Safe&quot; macro, handles unpaired surrogates and checks for string boundaries.
 *
 * The length can be negative for a NUL-terminated string.
 *
 * The offset may point to the lead surrogate unit
 * for a supplementary code point, in which case the macro will read
 * the following trail surrogate as well.
 * If the offset points to a trail surrogate or
 * to a single, unpaired lead surrogate, then c is set to that unpaired surrogate.
 *
 * @param s const UChar * string
 * @param i string offset, must be i&lt;length
 * @param length string length
 * @param c output UChar32 variable
 * @see U16_NEXT_UNSAFE
 * @stable ICU 2.4
