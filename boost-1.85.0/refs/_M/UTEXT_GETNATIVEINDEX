  *  inline version of utext_getNativeIndex(), for performance-critical situations.
  *
  * Get the current iterator position, which can range from 0 to 
  * the length of the text.
  * The position is a native index into the input text, in whatever format it
  * may have (possibly UTF-8 for example), and may not always be the same as
  * the corresponding UChar (UTF-16) index.
  * The returned position will always be aligned to a code point boundary.
