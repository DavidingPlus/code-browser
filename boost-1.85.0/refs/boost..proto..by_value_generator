    /// reference with ones held by value. Use with
    /// \c compose_generators to forward that result to another
    /// generator.
    ///
    /// Generators are intended for use as the first template parameter
    /// to the \c domain\&lt;\&gt; class template and control if and how
    /// expressions within that domain are to be customized.
    /// \c by_value_generator ensures all child nodes are
    /// held by value. This generator is typically composed with a
    /// second generator for further processing, as
    /// &lt;tt&gt;compose_generators\&lt;by_value_generator, MyGenerator\&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.</doc>
