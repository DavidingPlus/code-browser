     * Tests if the character is normalization-inert.
     * If true, then the character does not change, nor normalization-interact with
     * preceding or following characters.
     * In other words, a string containing this character can be normalized
     * by processing portions before this character and after this
     * character independently.
     * This is used for iterative normalization. See the class documentation for details.
     * Note that this operation may be significantly slower than hasBoundaryBefore().
