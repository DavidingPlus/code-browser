     * Get the sort key as an array of bytes from a char16_t buffer.
     * Sort key byte arrays are zero-terminated and can be compared using
     * strcmp().
     *
     * Note that sort keys are often less efficient than simply doing comparison.
     * For more details, see the ICU User Guide.
     *
     * @param source string to be processed.
     * @param sourceLength length of string to be processed.
     *        If -1, the string is 0 terminated and length will be decided by the
     *        function.
     * @param result buffer to store result in. If NULL, number of bytes needed
     *        will be returned.
     * @param resultLength length of the result buffer. If if not enough the
     *        buffer will be filled to capacity.
     * @return Number of bytes needed for storing the sort key
