   * @param n The number of bytes to append from the start of the output
   * sequence to the end of the input sequence. The remainder of the output
   * sequence is discarded.

   * Requires a preceding call &lt;tt&gt;prepare(x)&lt;/tt&gt; where &lt;tt&gt;x &gt;= n&lt;/tt&gt;, and
   * no intervening operations that modify the input or output sequence.
   *
   * @note If @c n is greater than the size of the output sequence, the entire
   * output sequence is moved to the input sequence and no error is issued.
