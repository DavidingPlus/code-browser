<doc f='include/unicode/uchar.h' l='372'>/** Binary Property Segment_Starter.
        ICU-specific property for characters that are starters in terms of
        Unicode normalization and combining character sequences.
        They have ccc=0 and do not occur in non-initial position of the
        canonical decomposition of any character
        (like a-umlaut in NFD and a Jamo T in an NFD(Hangul LVT)).
        ICU uses this property for segmenting a string for generating a set of
        canonically equivalent strings, e.g. for canonical closure while
        processing collation tailoring rules.
        @stable ICU 3.0 */</doc>
