     * Tests if the character always has a normalization boundary after it,
     * regardless of context.
     * If true, then the character does not normalization-interact with
     * following characters.
     * In other words, a string containing this character can be normalized
     * by processing portions up to this character and after this
     * character independently.
     * This is used for iterative normalization. See the class documentation for details.
     * Note that this operation may be significantly slower than hasBoundaryBefore().
     * @param c character to test
     * @return TRUE if c has a normalization boundary after it
