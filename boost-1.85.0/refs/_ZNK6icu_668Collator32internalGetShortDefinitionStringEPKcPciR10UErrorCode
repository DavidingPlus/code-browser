<doc f='include/unicode/coll.h' l='1136'>/** Get the short definition string for a collator. This internal API harvests the collator&apos;s
     *  locale and the attribute set and produces a string that can be used for opening
     *  a collator with the same attributes using the ucol_openFromShortString API.
     *  This string will be normalized.
     *  The structure and the syntax of the string is defined in the &quot;Naming collators&quot;
     *  section of the users guide:
     *  http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/concepts#TOC-Collator-naming-scheme
     *  This function supports preflighting.
     *
     *  This is internal, and intended to be used with delegate converters.
     *
     *  @param locale a locale that will appear as a collators locale in the resulting
     *                short string definition. If NULL, the locale will be harvested
     *                from the collator.
     *  @param buffer space to hold the resulting string
     *  @param capacity capacity of the buffer
     *  @param status for returning errors. All the preflighting errors are featured
     *  @return length of the resulting string
