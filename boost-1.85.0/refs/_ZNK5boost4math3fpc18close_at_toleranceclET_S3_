<doc f='boost-1.85.0/libs/test/include/boost/test/tools/floating_point_comparison.hpp' l='251'>/*! Compares two floating point numbers a and b such that their &quot;left&quot; relative difference |a-b|/a and/or
     * &quot;right&quot; relative difference |a-b|/b does not exceed specified relative (fraction) tolerance.
     *
     *  @param[in] left first floating point number to be compared
     *  @param[in] right second floating point number to be compared
     *
     * What is reported by @c tested_rel_diff in case of failure depends on the comparison method:
     * - for @c FPC_STRONG: the max of the two fractions
     * - for @c FPC_WEAK: the min of the two fractions
     * The rationale behind is to report the tolerance to set in order to make a test pass.
