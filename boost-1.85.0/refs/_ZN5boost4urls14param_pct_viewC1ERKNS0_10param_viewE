<def f='boost-1.85.0/libs/url/include/boost/url/param.hpp' l='816' ll='825' type='void boost::urls::param_pct_view::param_pct_view(const boost::urls::param_view &amp; p)'/>
<doc f='boost-1.85.0/libs/url/include/boost/url/param.hpp' l='783'>/** Construction

        This converts a param which may
        contain unvalidated percent-escapes into
        a param whose key and value are
        guaranteed to contain strings with no
        invalid percent-escapes, otherwise
        an exception is thrown.

        The new key and value reference
        the same corresponding underlying
        character buffers.
        Ownership of the buffers is not transferred;
        the caller is responsible for ensuring that
        the assigned buffers remain valid until
        they are no longer referenced.

        @par Example
        @code
        param_pct_view qp( param_view( &quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot; ) );
        @endcode

        @par Complexity
        Linear in `key.size() + value.size()`.

        @par Exception Safety
        Exceptions thrown on invalid input.

        @throw system_error
        `key` or `value` contains an invalid percent escape.

        @param p The param to construct from.
