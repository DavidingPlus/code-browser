       *  When the %auto_ptr goes out of scope, the object it owns is
       *  deleted.  If it no longer owns anything (i.e., @c get() is
       *  @c NULL), then this has no effect.
       *
       *  The C++ standard says there is supposed to be an empty throw
       *  specification here, but omitting it is standard conforming.  Its
       *  presence can be detected only if _Tp::~_Tp() throws, but this is
       *  prohibited.  [17.4.3.6]/2
