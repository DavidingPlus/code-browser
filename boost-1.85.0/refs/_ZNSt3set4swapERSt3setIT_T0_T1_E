       *  @brief  Swaps data with another %set.
       *  @param  __x  A %set of the same element and allocator types.
       *
       *  This exchanges the elements between two sets in constant
       *  time.  (It is only swapping a pointer, an integer, and an
       *  instance of the @c Compare type (which itself is often
       *  stateless and empty), so it should be quite fast.)  Note
       *  that the global std::swap() function is specialized such
       *  that std::swap(s1,s2) will feed to this function.
       *
       *  Whether the allocators are swapped depends on the allocator traits.
