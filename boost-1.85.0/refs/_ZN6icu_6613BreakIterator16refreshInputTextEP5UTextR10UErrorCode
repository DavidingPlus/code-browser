<doc f='include/unicode/brkiter.h' l='598'>/**
     *  Set the subject text string upon which the break iterator is operating
     *  without changing any other aspect of the matching state.
     *  The new and previous text strings must have the same content.
     *
     *  This function is intended for use in environments where ICU is operating on
     *  strings that may move around in memory.  It provides a mechanism for notifying
     *  ICU that the string has been relocated, and providing a new UText to access the
     *  string in its new position.
     *
     *  Note that the break iterator implementation never copies the underlying text
     *  of a string being processed, but always operates directly on the original text
     *  provided by the user. Refreshing simply drops the references to the old text
     *  and replaces them with references to the new.
     *
     *  Caution:  this function is normally used only by very specialized,
     *  system-level code.  One example use case is with garbage collection that moves
     *  the text in memory.
     *
     * @param input      The new (moved) text string.
     * @param status     Receives errors detected by this function.
     * @return           *this
