     * Thread safe client-buffer-based cloning operation

     * @param stackBuffer user allocated space for the new clone. If NULL new memory will be allocated.
     * If buffer is not large enough, new memory will be allocated.
     * @param BufferSize reference to size of allocated space.
     * If BufferSize == 0, a sufficient size for use in cloning will
     * be returned (&apos;pre-flighting&apos;)
     * If BufferSize is not enough for a stack-based safe clone,
     * new memory will be allocated.
     * @param status to indicate whether the operation went on smoothly or there were errors
     *  An informational status value, U_SAFECLONE_ALLOCATED_ERROR, is used if any allocations were
     *  necessary.
     * @return pointer to the new clone

     * @deprecated ICU 52. Use clone() instead.
