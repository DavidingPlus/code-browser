     * Enable case insensitive matching.  E.g., &quot;[ab]&quot; with this flag
     * will match &apos;a&apos;, &apos;A&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, and &apos;B&apos;.  &quot;[^ab]&quot; with this flag will
     * match all except &apos;a&apos;, &apos;A&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, and &apos;B&apos;. This performs a full
     * closure over case mappings, e.g. U+017F for s.
     *
     * The resulting set is a superset of the input for the code points but
     * not for the strings.
     * It performs a case mapping closure of the code points and adds
     * full case folding strings for the code points, and reduces strings of
     * the original set to their full case folding equivalents.
     *
     * This is designed for case-insensitive matches, for example
     * in regular expressions. The full code point case closure allows checking of
     * an input character directly against the closure set.
     * Strings are matched by comparing the case-folded form from the closure
     * set with an incremental case folding of the string in question.
     *
     * The closure set will also contain single code points if the original
     * set contained case-equivalent strings (like U+00DF for &quot;ss&quot; or &quot;Ss&quot; etc.).
     * This is not necessary (that is, redundant) for the above matching method
     * but results in the same closure sets regardless of whether the original
     * set contained the code point or a string.
