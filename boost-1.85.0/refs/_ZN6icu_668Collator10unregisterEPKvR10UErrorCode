<doc f='include/unicode/coll.h' l='834'>/**
     * Unregister a previously-registered Collator or CollatorFactory
     * using the key returned from the register call.  Key becomes
     * invalid after a successful call and should not be used again.
     * The object corresponding to the key will be deleted.
     * Because ICU may choose to cache collators internally, this should
     * be called during application shutdown, after all calls to
     * Collator::createInstance to avoid undefined behavior.
     * @param key the registry key returned by a previous call to registerInstance
     * @param status the in/out status code, no special meanings are assigned
     * @return TRUE if the collator for the key was successfully unregistered
     * @stable ICU 2.6
