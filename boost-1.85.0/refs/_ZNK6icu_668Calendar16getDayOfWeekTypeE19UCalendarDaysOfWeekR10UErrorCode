     * Returns whether the given day of the week is a weekday, a weekend day,
     * or a day that transitions from one to the other, for the locale and
     * calendar system associated with this Calendar (the locale&apos;s region is
     * often the most determinant factor). If a transition occurs at midnight,
     * then the days before and after the transition will have the
     * type UCAL_WEEKDAY or UCAL_WEEKEND. If a transition occurs at a time
     * other than midnight, then the day of the transition will have
     * the type UCAL_WEEKEND_ONSET or UCAL_WEEKEND_CEASE. In this case, the
     * method getWeekendTransition() will return the point of
     * transition.
     * @param dayOfWeek The day of the week whose type is desired (UCAL_SUNDAY..UCAL_SATURDAY).
     * @param status The error code for the operation.
     * @return The UCalendarWeekdayType for the day of the week.
