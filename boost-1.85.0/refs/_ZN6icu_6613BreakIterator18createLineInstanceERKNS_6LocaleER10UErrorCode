     * Create BreakIterator for line-breaks using specified locale.
     * Returns an instance of a BreakIterator implementing line breaks. Line
     * breaks are logically possible line breaks, actual line breaks are
     * usually determined based on display width.
     * LineBreak is useful for word wrapping text.
     * @param where the locale.
     * @param status The error code.
     * @return A BreakIterator for line-breaks.  The UErrorCode&amp; status
     * parameter is used to return status information to the user.
     * To check whether the construction succeeded or not, you should check
     * the value of U_SUCCESS(err).  If you wish more detailed information, you
     * can check for informational error results which still indicate success.
     * U_USING_FALLBACK_WARNING indicates that a fall back locale was used.  For
     * example, &apos;de_CH&apos; was requested, but nothing was found there, so &apos;de&apos; was
     * used.  U_USING_DEFAULT_WARNING indicates that the default locale data was
     * used; neither the requested locale nor any of its fall back locales
     * could be found.
     * The caller owns the returned object and is responsible for deleting it.
