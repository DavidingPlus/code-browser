<doc f='boost-1.85.0/libs/property_tree/include/boost/property_tree/detail/rapidxml.hpp' l='982'>//! Gets next sibling node, optionally matching node name. 
        //! Behaviour is undefined if node has no parent.
        //! Use parent() to test if node has a parent.
        //! \param n Name of sibling to find, or 0 to return next sibling regardless of its name; this string doesn&apos;t have to be zero-terminated if nsize is non-zero
        //! \param nsize Size of name, in characters, or 0 to have size calculated automatically from string
        //! \param case_sensitive Should name comparison be case-sensitive; non case-sensitive comparison works properly only for ASCII characters
        //! \return Pointer to found sibling, or 0 if not found.</doc>
