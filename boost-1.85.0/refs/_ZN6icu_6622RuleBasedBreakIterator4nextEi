     * Advances the iterator either forward or backward the specified number of steps.
     * Negative values move backward, and positive values move forward.  This is
     * equivalent to repeatedly calling next() or previous().
     * @param n The number of steps to move.  The sign indicates the direction
     * (negative is backwards, and positive is forwards).
     * @return The character offset of the boundary position n boundaries away from
     * the current one.
