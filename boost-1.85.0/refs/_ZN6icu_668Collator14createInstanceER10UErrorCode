     * Creates the Collator object for the current default locale.
     * The default locale is determined by Locale::getDefault.
     * The UErrorCode&amp; err parameter is used to return status information to the user.
     * To check whether the construction succeeded or not, you should check the
     * value of U_SUCCESS(err).  If you wish more detailed information, you can
     * check for informational error results which still indicate success.
     * U_USING_FALLBACK_ERROR indicates that a fall back locale was used. For
     * example, &apos;de_CH&apos; was requested, but nothing was found there, so &apos;de&apos; was
     * used. U_USING_DEFAULT_ERROR indicates that the default locale data was
     * used; neither the requested locale nor any of its fall back locales
     * could be found.
     * The caller owns the returned object and is responsible for deleting it.
     *
     * @param err    the error code status.
     * @return       the collation object of the default locale.(for example, en_US)
     * @see Locale#getDefault
