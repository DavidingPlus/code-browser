   * Return the next character in the normalized text.
   * (Post-increment semantics.)
   * If the end of the text has already been reached, DONE is returned.
   * The DONE value could be confused with a U+FFFF non-character code point
   * in the text. If this is possible, you can test getIndex()&lt;endIndex()
   * before calling next(), or (getIndex()&lt;endIndex() || last()!=DONE)
   * after calling next(). (Calling last() will change the iterator state!)
   *
   * The C API unorm_next() is more efficient and does not have this ambiguity.
   *
   * @return the next normalized code point
   * @deprecated ICU 56 Use Normalizer2 instead.
