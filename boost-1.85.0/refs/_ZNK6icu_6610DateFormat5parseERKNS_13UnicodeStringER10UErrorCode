     * Parse a date/time string. For example, a time text &quot;07/10/96 4:5 PM, PDT&quot;
     * will be parsed into a UDate that is equivalent to Date(837039928046).
     * Parsing begins at the beginning of the string and proceeds as far as
     * possible.  Assuming no parse errors were encountered, this function
     * doesn&apos;t return any information about how much of the string was consumed
     * by the parsing.  If you need that information, use the version of
     * parse() that takes a ParsePosition.
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * By default, parsing is lenient: If the input is not in the form used by
     * this object&apos;s format method but can still be parsed as a date, then the
     * parse succeeds. Clients may insist on strict adherence to the format by
     * calling setLenient(false).
     * @see DateFormat::setLenient(boolean)
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * Note that the normal date formats associated with some calendars - such
     * as the Chinese lunar calendar - do not specify enough fields to enable
     * dates to be parsed unambiguously. In the case of the Chinese lunar
     * calendar, while the year within the current 60-year cycle is specified,
     * the number of such cycles since the start date of the calendar (in the
     * ERA field of the Calendar object) is not normally part of the format,
     * and parsing may assume the wrong era. For cases such as this it is
     * recommended that clients parse using the method
     * parse(const UnicodeString&amp;, Calendar&amp; cal, ParsePosition&amp;)
     * with the Calendar passed in set to the current date, or to a date
     * within the era/cycle that should be assumed if absent in the format.
     *
     * @param text      The date/time string to be parsed into a UDate value.
     * @param status    Output param to be set to success/failure code. If
     *                  &apos;text&apos; cannot be parsed, it will be set to a failure
     *                  code.
     * @return          The parsed UDate value, if successful.
