     * Creates a RuleBasedNumberFormat that behaves according to the description
     * passed in.  The formatter uses the default locale.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The localizations data provides information about the public
     * rule sets and their localized display names for different
     * locales. The first element in the list is an array of the names
     * of the public rule sets.  The first element in this array is
     * the initial default ruleset.  The remaining elements in the
     * list are arrays of localizations of the names of the public
     * rule sets.  Each of these is one longer than the initial array,
     * with the first String being the ULocale ID, and the remaining
     * Strings being the localizations of the rule set names, in the
     * same order as the initial array.  Arrays are NULL-terminated.
     * @param rules A description of the formatter&apos;s desired behavior.
     * See the class documentation for a complete explanation of the description
     * syntax.
     * @param localizations the localization information.
     * names in the description.  These will be copied by the constructor.
     * @param perror The parse error if an error was encountered.
     * @param status The status indicating whether the constructor succeeded.
     * @stable ICU 3.2
