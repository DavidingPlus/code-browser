       *  @brief  Array-indexing support.
       *  @param  __position  Index into the %bitset.
       *  @return A bool for a &lt;em&gt;const %bitset&lt;/em&gt;.  For non-const
       *           bitsets, an instance of the reference proxy class.
       *  @note  These operators do no range checking and throw no exceptions,
       *         as required by DR 11 to the standard.
       *
       *  _GLIBCXX_RESOLVE_LIB_DEFECTS Note that this implementation already
       *  resolves DR 11 (items 1 and 2), but does not do the range-checking
       *  required by that DR&apos;s resolution.  -pme
       *  The DR has since been changed:  range-checking is a precondition
       *  (users&apos; responsibility), and these functions must not throw.  -pme
