   * @param pos Position of the first byte to represent in the buffer sequence
   *
   * @param n The number of bytes to return in the buffer sequence. If the
   * underlying memory is shorter, the buffer sequence represents as many bytes
   * as are available.
   *
   * @returns An object of type @c mutable_buffers_type that satisfies
   * MutableBufferSequence requirements, representing the vector memory.
   *
   * @note The returned object is invalidated by any @c dynamic_vector_buffer
   * or @c vector member function that resizes or erases the vector.
