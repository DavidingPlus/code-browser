     * \param name Name of the message queue to be associated with.
     * \param oflow_policy Queue behavior policy in case of overflow.
     * \param perms Access permissions for the associated message queue. The permissions will only be used
     *              if the queue implementation has to create system objects while operating.
     *              This parameter is currently not used on POSIX systems.
