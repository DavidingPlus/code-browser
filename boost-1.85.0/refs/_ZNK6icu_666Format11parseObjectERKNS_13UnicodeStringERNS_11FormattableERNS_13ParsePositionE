     * Parse a string to produce an object.  This is a pure virtual
     * method which subclasses must implement.  This method allows
     * polymorphic parsing of strings into Formattable objects.
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * Before calling, set parse_pos.index to the offset you want to
     * start parsing at in the source.  After calling, parse_pos.index
     * is the end of the text you parsed.  If error occurs, index is
     * unchanged.
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * When parsing, leading whitespace is discarded (with successful
     * parse), while trailing whitespace is left as is.
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * Example:
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * Parsing &quot;_12_xy&quot; (where _ represents a space) for a number,
     * with index == 0 will result in the number 12, with
     * parse_pos.index updated to 3 (just before the second space).
     * Parsing a second time will result in a failing UErrorCode since
     * &quot;xy&quot; is not a number, and leave index at 3.
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * Subclasses will typically supply specific parse methods that
     * return different types of values. Since methods can&apos;t overload
     * on return types, these will typically be named &quot;parse&quot;, while
     * this polymorphic method will always be called parseObject.  Any
     * parse method that does not take a parse_pos should set status
     * to an error value when no text in the required format is at the
     * start position.
     *
     * @param source    The string to be parsed into an object.
     * @param result    Formattable to be set to the parse result.
     *                  If parse fails, return contents are undefined.
     * @param parse_pos The position to start parsing at. Upon return
     *                  this param is set to the position after the
     *                  last character successfully parsed. If the
     *                  source is not parsed successfully, this param
     *                  will remain unchanged.
