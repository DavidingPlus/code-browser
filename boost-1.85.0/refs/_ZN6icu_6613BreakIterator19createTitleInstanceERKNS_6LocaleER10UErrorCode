     * Create BreakIterator for title-casing breaks using the specified locale
     * Returns an instance of a BreakIterator implementing title breaks.
     * The iterator returned locates title boundaries as described for
     * Unicode 3.2 only. For Unicode 4.0 and above title boundary iteration,
     * please use a word boundary iterator. See {@link #createWordInstance }.
     *
     * @param where the locale.
     * @param status The error code.
     * @return A BreakIterator for title-breaks.  The UErrorCode&amp; status
     * parameter is used to return status information to the user.
     * To check whether the construction succeeded or not, you should check
     * the value of U_SUCCESS(err).  If you wish more detailed information, you
     * can check for informational error results which still indicate success.
     * U_USING_FALLBACK_WARNING indicates that a fall back locale was used.  For
     * example, &apos;de_CH&apos; was requested, but nothing was found there, so &apos;de&apos; was
     * used.  U_USING_DEFAULT_WARNING indicates that the default locale data was
     * used; neither the requested locale nor any of its fall back locales
     * could be found.
     * The caller owns the returned object and is responsible for deleting it.
     * @deprecated ICU 64 Use createWordInstance instead.
