   * underlying memory is shorter, the buffer sequence represents as many bytes
   * as are available.
   *
   * @returns An object of type @c mutable_buffers_type that satisfies
   * MutableBufferSequence requirements, representing the basic_string memory.
   *
   * @note The returned object is invalidated by any @c dynamic_string_buffer
   * or @c basic_string member function that resizes or erases the string.
