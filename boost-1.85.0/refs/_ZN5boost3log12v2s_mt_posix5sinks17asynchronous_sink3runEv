     *
     * \li the thread is interrupted due to either standard thread interruption or a call to \c stop
     * \li an exception is thrown while processing a log record in the backend, and the exception is
     *     not terminated by the exception handler, if one is installed
     *
     * \pre The sink frontend must be constructed without spawning a dedicated thread
