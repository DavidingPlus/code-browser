<doc f='boost-1.85.0/libs/container/include/boost/container/uses_allocator_fwd.hpp' l='48'>//! The `erased_type` struct is an empty struct that serves as a placeholder for a type
//! T in situations where the actual type T is determined at runtime. For example,
//! the nested type, `allocator_type`, is an alias for `erased_type` in classes that
//! use type-erased allocators.</doc>
