     * Constructor. The method is used to construct an object and create or open the associated
     * message queue. The constructed object will be in running state if the message queue is
     * successfully created or opened. If the message queue that is identified by the name already
     * exists then the other queue parameters are ignored. The actual queue parameters can be obtained
     * with accessors from the constructed object.
     *
     * \post &lt;tt&gt;is_open() == true&lt;/tt&gt;
     *
     * \param name Name of the message queue to be associated with.
     * \param capacity Maximum number of allocation blocks the queue can hold.
     * \param block_size Size in bytes of allocation block. Must be a power of 2.
     * \param oflow_policy Queue behavior policy in case of overflow.
     * \param perms Access permissions for the associated message queue.
