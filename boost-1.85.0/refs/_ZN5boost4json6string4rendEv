<doc f='boost-1.85.0/libs/json/include/boost/json/string.hpp' l='1312'>/** Return a reverse iterator to the character following the last character of the reversed container.

        Returns the pointed-to character that corresponds
        to the character preceding the first character of
        the non-reversed container.
        This character acts as a placeholder, attempting
        to access it results in undefined behavior.

        @par Complexity
        Constant.

        @par Exception Safety
        No-throw guarantee.
