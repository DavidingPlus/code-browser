     * Reset the break iterator to operate over the text represented by
     * the UText.  The iterator position is reset to the start.
     *
     * This function makes a shallow clone of the supplied UText.  This means
     * that the caller is free to immediately close or otherwise reuse the
     * Utext that was passed as a parameter, but that the underlying text itself
     * must not be altered while being referenced by the break iterator.
     *
     * @param text    The UText used to change the text.
     * @param status  Receives any error codes.
     * @stable ICU 3.4
