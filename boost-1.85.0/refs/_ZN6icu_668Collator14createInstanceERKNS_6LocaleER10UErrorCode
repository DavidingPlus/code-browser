     * Gets the collation object for the desired locale. The
     * resource of the desired locale will be loaded.
     *
     * Locale::getRoot() is the base collation table and all other languages are
     * built on top of it with additional language-specific modifications.
     *
     * For some languages, multiple collation types are available;
     * for example, &quot;de@collation=phonebook&quot;.
     * Starting with ICU 54, collation attributes can be specified via locale keywords as well,
     * in the old locale extension syntax (&quot;el@colCaseFirst=upper&quot;)
     * or in language tag syntax (&quot;el-u-kf-upper&quot;).
     * See &lt;a href=&quot;http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/api&quot;&gt;User Guide: Collation API&lt;/a&gt;.
     *
     * The UErrorCode&amp; err parameter is used to return status information to the user.
     * To check whether the construction succeeded or not, you should check
     * the value of U_SUCCESS(err).  If you wish more detailed information, you
     * can check for informational error results which still indicate success.
     * U_USING_FALLBACK_ERROR indicates that a fall back locale was used.  For
     * example, &apos;de_CH&apos; was requested, but nothing was found there, so &apos;de&apos; was
     * used.  U_USING_DEFAULT_ERROR indicates that the default locale data was
     * used; neither the requested locale nor any of its fall back locales
     * could be found.
     *
     * The caller owns the returned object and is responsible for deleting it.
     * @param loc    The locale ID for which to open a collator.
     * @param err    the error code status.
     * @return       the created table-based collation object based on the desired
     *               locale.
