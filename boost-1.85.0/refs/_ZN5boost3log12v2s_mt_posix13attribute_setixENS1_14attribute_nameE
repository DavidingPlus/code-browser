     * Combined lookup/insertion operator. The operator semantics depends on the further usage of the returned reference.
     * \li If the reference is used as an assignment target, the assignment expression is equivalent to element insertion,
     *     where the element is composed of the second argument of the \c operator[] as a key and the second argument of assignment
     *     as a mapped value.
     * \li If the returned reference is used in context where a conversion to the mapped type is required,
     *     the result of the conversion is equivalent to the mapped value found with the second argument of the \c operator[] as a key,
     *     if such an element exists in the container, or a default-constructed mapped value, if an element does not exist in the
     *     container.
     *
     * \param key Attribute name.
     * \return A smart reference object of unspecified type.
