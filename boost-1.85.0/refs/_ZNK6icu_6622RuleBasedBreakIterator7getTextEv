     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Return a CharacterIterator over the text being analyzed.
     * The returned character iterator is owned by the break iterator, and must
     * not be deleted by the caller.  Repeated calls to this function may
     * return the same CharacterIterator.
     * &lt;/p&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The returned character iterator must not be used concurrently with
     * the break iterator.  If concurrent operation is needed, clone the
     * returned character iterator first and operate on the clone.
     * &lt;/p&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * When the break iterator is operating on text supplied via a UText,
     * this function will fail.  Lacking any way to signal failures, it
     * returns an CharacterIterator containing no text.
     * The function getUText() provides similar functionality,
     * is reliable, and is more efficient.
     * &lt;/p&gt;

     * TODO:  deprecate this function?
