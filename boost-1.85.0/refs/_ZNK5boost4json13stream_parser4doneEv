        This function returns `true` when all of these
        conditions are met:

        @li A complete serialized JSON text has been
            presented to the parser, and

        @li No error has occurred since the parser
            was constructed, or since the last call
            to @ref reset,

        @par Complexity
        Constant.

        @par Exception Safety
        No-throw guarantee.
