     * @brief Trait used to construct an instance of a @c VertexProperty,
     * which is a class type that stores the properties associated with a
     * vertex in a graph, from just the name of that vertex property. This
     * operation is used when an operation is required to map from a
     * vertex name to a vertex descriptor (e.g., to add an edge outgoing
     * from that vertex), but no vertex by the name exists. The function
     * object provided by this trait will be used to add new vertices
     * based only on their names. Since this cannot be done for arbitrary
     * types, the default behavior is to throw an exception when this
     * routine is called, which requires that all named vertices be added
     * before adding any edges by name.
