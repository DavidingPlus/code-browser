  Each malloc space may include non-contiguous segments, held in a
  list headed by an embedded malloc_segment record representing the
  top-most space. Segments also include flags holding properties of
  the space. Large chunks that are directly allocated by mmap are not
  included in this list. They are instead independently created and
  destroyed without otherwise keeping track of them.

  Segment management mainly comes into play for spaces allocated by
  MMAP.  Any call to MMAP might or might not return memory that is
  adjacent to an existing segment.  MORECORE normally contiguously
  extends the current space, so this space is almost always adjacent,
  which is simpler and faster to deal with. (This is why MORECORE is
  used preferentially to MMAP when both are available -- see
  sys_alloc.)  When allocating using MMAP, we don&apos;t use any of the
  hinting mechanisms (inconsistently) supported in various
  implementations of unix mmap, or distinguish reserving from
  committing memory. Instead, we just ask for space, and exploit
  contiguity when we get it.  It is probably possible to do
  better than this on some systems, but no general scheme seems
  to be significantly better.

  Management entails a simpler variant of the consolidation scheme
  used for chunks to reduce fragmentation -- new adjacent memory is
  normally prepended or appended to an existing segment. However,
  there are limitations compared to chunk consolidation that mostly
  reflect the fact that segment processing is relatively infrequent
  (occurring only when getting memory from system) and that we
  don&apos;t expect to have huge numbers of segments:

  * Segments are not indexed, so traversal requires linear scans.  (It
    would be possible to index these, but is not worth the extra
    overhead and complexity for most programs on most platforms.)
  * New segments are only appended to old ones when holding top-most
    memory; if they cannot be prepended to others, they are held in
    different segments.

  Except for the top-most segment of an mstate, each segment record
  is kept at the tail of its segment. Segments are added by pushing
  segment records onto the list headed by &amp;mstate.seg for the
  containing mstate.

  Segment flags control allocation/merge/deallocation policies:
  * If EXTERN_BIT set, then we did not allocate this segment,
    and so should not try to deallocate or merge with others.
    (This currently holds only for the initial segment passed
    into create_mspace_with_base.)
  * If USE_MMAP_BIT set, the segment may be merged with
    other surrounding mmapped segments and trimmed/de-allocated
    using munmap.
  * If neither bit is set, then the segment was obtained using
    MORECORE so can be merged with surrounding MORECORE&apos;d segments
    and deallocated/trimmed using MORECORE with negative arguments.
