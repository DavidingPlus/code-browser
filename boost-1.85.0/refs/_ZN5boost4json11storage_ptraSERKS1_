        This function assigns a pointer that
        points to the same memory resource as `other`,
        with the same ownership:

        @li If `other` is non-owning, then `*this`
        will be be non-owning.

        @li If `other` has shared ownership, then
        `*this` will acquire shared ownership.

        If `*this` previously had shared ownership,
        it is released before the function returns.

        @par Complexity
        Constant.

        @par Exception Safety
        No-throw guarantee.

        @param other The storage pointer to copy.
