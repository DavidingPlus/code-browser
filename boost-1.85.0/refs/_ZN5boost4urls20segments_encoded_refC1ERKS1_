        After construction, both views
        reference the same url. Ownership is not
        transferred; the caller is responsible
        for ensuring the lifetime of the url
        extends until it is no longer
        referenced.

        @par Postconditions
        @code
        &amp;this-&gt;url() == &amp;other.url();
        @endcode

        @par Complexity
        Constant.

        @par Exception Safety
        Throws nothing.

        @param other The other view.
