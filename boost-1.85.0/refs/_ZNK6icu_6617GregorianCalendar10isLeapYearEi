     * Return true if the given year is a leap year. Determination of whether a year is
     * a leap year is actually very complicated. We do something crude and mostly
     * correct here, but for a real determination you need a lot of contextual
     * information. For example, in Sweden, the change from Julian to Gregorian happened
     * in a complex way resulting in missed leap years and double leap years between
     * 1700 and 1753. Another example is that after the start of the Julian calendar in
     * 45 B.C., the leap years did not regularize until 8 A.D. This method ignores these
     * quirks, and pays attention only to the Julian onset date and the Gregorian
     * cutover (which can be changed).
     *
     * @param year  The given year.
     * @return      True if the given year is a leap year; false otherwise.
