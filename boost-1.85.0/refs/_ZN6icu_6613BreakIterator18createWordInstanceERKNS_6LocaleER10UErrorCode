     * Create BreakIterator for word-breaks using the given locale.
     * Returns an instance of a BreakIterator implementing word breaks.
     * WordBreak is useful for word selection (ex. double click)
     * @param where the locale.
     * @param status the error code
     * @return A BreakIterator for word-breaks.  The UErrorCode&amp; status
     * parameter is used to return status information to the user.
     * To check whether the construction succeeded or not, you should check
     * the value of U_SUCCESS(err).  If you wish more detailed information, you
     * can check for informational error results which still indicate success.
     * U_USING_FALLBACK_WARNING indicates that a fall back locale was used.  For
     * example, &apos;de_CH&apos; was requested, but nothing was found there, so &apos;de&apos; was
     * used.  U_USING_DEFAULT_WARNING indicates that the default locale data was
     * used; neither the requested locale nor any of its fall back locales
     * could be found.
     * The caller owns the returned object and is responsible for deleting it.
