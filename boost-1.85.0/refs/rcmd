   The local user is LOCUSER, on the remote machine the command is
   executed as REMUSER.  In *FD2P the descriptor to the socket for the
   connection is returned.  The caller must have the right to use a
   reserved port.  When the function returns *AHOST contains the
   official host name.

   This function is not part of POSIX and therefore no official
   cancellation point.  But due to similarity with an POSIX interface
   or due to the implementation it is a cancellation point and
   therefore not marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
