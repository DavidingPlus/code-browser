 * The sink backend expects pre-synchronized calls, all needed synchronization is implemented
 * in the frontend (IOW, only one thread is feeding records to the backend concurrently, but
 * it is possible for several threads to write sequentially). Note that if a frontend supports
 * synchronized record feeding, it will also report capable of concurrent record feeding.
