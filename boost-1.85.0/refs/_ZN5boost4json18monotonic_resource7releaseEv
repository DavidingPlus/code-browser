        This function deallocates all allocated memory.
        If an initial buffer was provided upon construction,
        then all of the bytes will be available again for
        allocation. Allocated memory is deallocated even
        if deallocate has not been called for some of
        the allocated blocks.

        @par Complexity
        Linear in the number of deallocations performed.

        @par Exception Safety
        No-throw guarantee.
