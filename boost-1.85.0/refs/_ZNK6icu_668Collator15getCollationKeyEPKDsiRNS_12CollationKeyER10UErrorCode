     * Transforms the string into a series of characters that can be compared

     * &lt;p&gt;Use CollationKey::equals or CollationKey::compare to compare the
     * generated sort keys.
     * &lt;p&gt;If the source string is null, a null collation key will be returned.

     * Note that sort keys are often less efficient than simply doing comparison.
