     * Gets the value for a given time field. Recalculate the current time field values
     * if the time value has been changed by a call to setTime(). Return zero for unset
     * fields if any fields have been explicitly set by a call to set(). To force a
     * recomputation of all fields regardless of the previous state, call complete().
     * This method is semantically const, but may alter the object in memory.
     *
     * @param field  The given time field.
     * @param status Fill-in parameter which receives the status of the operation.
     * @return       The value for the given time field, or zero if the field is unset,
     *               and set() has been called for any other field.
     * @deprecated ICU 2.6. Use get(UCalendarDateFields field, UErrorCode&amp; status) instead.
