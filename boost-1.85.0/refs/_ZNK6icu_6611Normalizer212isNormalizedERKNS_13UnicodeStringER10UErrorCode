     * Tests if the string is normalized.
     * Internally, in cases where the quickCheck() method would return &quot;maybe&quot;
     * (which is only possible for the two COMPOSE modes) this method
     * resolves to &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to provide a definitive result,
     * at the cost of doing more work in those cases.
     * @param s input string
     * @param errorCode Standard ICU error code. Its input value must
     *                  pass the U_SUCCESS() test, or else the function returns
     *                  immediately. Check for U_FAILURE() on output or use with
     *                  function chaining. (See User Guide for details.)
     * @return TRUE if s is normalized
