     * Returns the length of the initial substring of the input string which
     * consists only of characters and strings that are contained in this set
     * (USET_SPAN_CONTAINED, USET_SPAN_SIMPLE),
     * or only of characters and strings that are not contained
     * in this set (USET_SPAN_NOT_CONTAINED).
     * See USetSpanCondition for details.
     * Similar to the strspn() C library function.
     * Malformed byte sequences are treated according to contains(0xfffd).
     * This function works faster with a frozen set and with a non-negative string length argument.
     * @param s start of the string (UTF-8)
     * @param length of the string; can be -1 for NUL-terminated
     * @param spanCondition specifies the containment condition
     * @return the length of the initial substring according to the spanCondition;
     *         0 if the start of the string does not fit the spanCondition
     * @stable ICU 3.8
     * @see USetSpanCondition
