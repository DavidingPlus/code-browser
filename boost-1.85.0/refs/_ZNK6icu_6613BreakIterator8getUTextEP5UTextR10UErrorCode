      *  Get a UText for the text being analyzed.
      *  The returned UText is a shallow clone of the UText used internally
      *  by the break iterator implementation.  It can safely be used to
      *  access the text without impacting any break iterator operations,
      *  but the underlying text itself must not be altered.
      *
      * @param fillIn A UText to be filled in.  If NULL, a new UText will be
      *           allocated to hold the result.
      * @param status receives any error codes.
      * @return   The current UText for this break iterator.  If an input
      *           UText was provided, it will always be returned.
