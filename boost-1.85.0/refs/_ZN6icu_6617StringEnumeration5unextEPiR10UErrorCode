     * &lt;p&gt;Returns the next element as a NUL-terminated char16_t*.  If there
     * are no more elements, returns NULL.  If the resultLength pointer
     * is not NULL, the length of the string (not counting the
     * terminating NUL) is returned at that address.  If an error
     * status is returned, the value at resultLength is undefined.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;The returned pointer is owned by this iterator and must not be
     * deleted by the caller.  The pointer is valid until the next call
     * to next, unext, snext, reset, or the enumerator&apos;s destructor.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;If the iterator is out of sync with its service, status is set
     * to U_ENUM_OUT_OF_SYNC_ERROR and NULL is returned.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * Starting with ICU 2.8, the default implementation calls snext()
     * and handles the conversion.
     *
     * @param status the error code.
     * @param resultLength a ponter to receive the length, can be NULL.
     * @return a pointer to the string, or NULL.
