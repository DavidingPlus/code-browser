   * Unescape a single escape sequence and return the represented
   * character.  See unescape() for a listing of the recognized escape
   * sequences.  The character at offset-1 is assumed (without
   * checking) to be a backslash.  If the escape sequence is
   * ill-formed, or the offset is out of range, U_SENTINEL=-1 is
   * returned.
   *
   * @param offset an input output parameter.  On input, it is the
   * offset into this string where the escape sequence is located,
   * after the initial backslash.  On output, it is advanced after the
   * last character parsed.  On error, it is not advanced at all.
   * @return the character represented by the escape sequence at
   * offset, or U_SENTINEL=-1 on error.
