     * &lt;p&gt;Return the number of elements that the iterator traverses.  If
     * the iterator is out of sync with its service, status is set to
     * U_ENUM_OUT_OF_SYNC_ERROR, and the return value is zero.&lt;/p&gt;

     * &lt;p&gt;The return value will not change except possibly as a result of
     * a subsequent call to reset, or if the iterator becomes out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;This is a convenience function. It can end up being very
     * expensive as all the items might have to be pre-fetched
     * (depending on the storage format of the data being
     * traversed).&lt;/p&gt;
     *
     * @param status the error code.
     * @return number of elements in the iterator.
