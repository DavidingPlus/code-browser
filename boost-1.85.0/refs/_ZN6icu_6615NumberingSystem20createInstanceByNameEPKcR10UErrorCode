     * Create a numbering system from one of the predefined numbering systems specified
     * by CLDR and known to ICU, such as &quot;latn&quot;, &quot;arabext&quot;, or &quot;hanidec&quot;; the full list
     * is returned by unumsys_openAvailableNames. Note that some of the names listed at
     * http://unicode.org/repos/cldr/tags/latest/common/bcp47/number.xml - e.g.
     * default, native, traditional, finance - do not identify specific numbering systems,
     * but rather key values that may only be used as part of a locale, which in turn
     * defines how they are mapped to a specific numbering system such as &quot;latn&quot; or &quot;hant&quot;.
     *
     * @param name   The name of the numbering system.
     * @param status ICU status; set to U_UNSUPPORTED_ERROR if numbering system not found.
     * @return The NumberingSystem instance, or nullptr if not found.
     * @stable ICU 4.2
