<doc f='include/unicode/rbbi.h' l='573'>/**
     * Return the binary form of compiled break rules,
     * which can then be used to create a new break iterator at some
     * time in the future.  Creating a break iterator from pre-compiled rules
     * is much faster than building one from the source form of the
     * break rules.
     *
     * The binary data can only be used with the same version of ICU
     *  and on the same platform type (processor endian-ness)
     *
     * @param length Returns the length of the binary data.  (Out parameter.)
     *
     * @return   A pointer to the binary (compiled) rule data.  The storage
     *           belongs to the RulesBasedBreakIterator object, not the
     *           caller, and must not be modified or deleted.
     * @stable ICU 4.8
