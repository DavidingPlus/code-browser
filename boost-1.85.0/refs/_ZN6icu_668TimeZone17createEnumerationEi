     * Returns an enumeration over time zone IDs with a given raw
     * offset from GMT.  There may be several times zones with the
     * same GMT offset that differ in the way they handle daylight
     * savings time.  For example, the state of Arizona doesn&apos;t
     * observe daylight savings time.  If you ask for the time zone
     * IDs corresponding to GMT-7:00, you&apos;ll get back an enumeration
     * over two time zone IDs: &quot;America/Denver,&quot; which corresponds to
     * Mountain Standard Time in the winter and Mountain Daylight Time
     * in the summer, and &quot;America/Phoenix&quot;, which corresponds to
     * Mountain Standard Time year-round, even in the summer.
     *
     * @param rawOffset an offset from GMT in milliseconds, ignoring
     * the effect of daylight savings time, if any
     * @return an enumeration object, owned by the caller
     * @stable ICU 2.4
