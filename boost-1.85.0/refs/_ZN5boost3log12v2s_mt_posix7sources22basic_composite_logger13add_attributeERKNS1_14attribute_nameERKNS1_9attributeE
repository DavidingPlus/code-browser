     * The method adds an attribute to the source-specific attribute set. The attribute will be implicitly added to
     * every log record made with the current logger.
     *
     * \param name The attribute name.
     * \param attr The attribute factory.
     * \return A pair of values. If the second member is \c true, then the attribute is added and the first member points to the
     *         attribute. Otherwise the attribute was not added and the first member points to the attribute that prevents
     *         addition.
