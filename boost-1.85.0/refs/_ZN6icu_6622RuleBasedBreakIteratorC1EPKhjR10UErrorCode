<doc f='include/unicode/rbbi.h' l='192'>/**
     * Construct a RuleBasedBreakIterator from a set of precompiled binary rules.
     * Binary rules are obtained from RulesBasedBreakIterator::getBinaryRules().
     * Construction of a break iterator in this way is substantially faster than
     * construction from source rules.
     *
     * Ownership of the storage containing the compiled rules remains with the
     * caller of this function.  The compiled rules must not be  modified or
     * deleted during the life of the break iterator.
     *
     * The compiled rules are not compatible across different major versions of ICU.
     * The compiled rules are compatible only between machines with the same
     * byte ordering (little or big endian) and the same base character set family
     * (ASCII or EBCDIC).
     *
     * @see #getBinaryRules
     * @param compiledRules A pointer to the compiled break rules to be used.
     * @param ruleLength The length of the compiled break rules, in bytes.  This
     *   corresponds to the length value produced by getBinaryRules().
     * @param status Information on any errors encountered, including invalid
     *   binary rules.
     * @stable ICU 4.8
