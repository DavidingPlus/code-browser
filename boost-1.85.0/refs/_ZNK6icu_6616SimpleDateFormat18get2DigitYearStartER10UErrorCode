     * Get the start UDate used to interpret two-digit year strings.
     * When dates are parsed having 2-digit year strings, they are placed within
     * a assumed range of 100 years starting on the two digit start date.  For
     * example, the string &quot;24-Jan-17&quot; may be in the year 1817, 1917, 2017, or
     * some other year.  SimpleDateFormat chooses a year so that the resultant
     * date is on or after the two digit start date and within 100 years of the
     * two digit start date.
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * By default, the two digit start date is set to 80 years before the current
     * time at which a SimpleDateFormat object is created.
     * @param status Filled in with U_ZERO_ERROR if the parse was successful, and with
     *               an error value if there was a parse error.
