     * ucpmap_getRange() enumerates all same-value ranges as stored in the map,
     * except that lead surrogates (U+D800..U+DBFF) are treated as having the
     * surrogateValue, which is passed to getRange() as a separate parameter.
     * The surrogateValue is not transformed via filter().
     * See U_IS_LEAD(c).
     *
     * Most users should use UCPMAP_RANGE_NORMAL instead.
     *
     * This option is useful for maps that map surrogate code *units* to
     * special values optimized for UTF-16 string processing
     * or for special error behavior for unpaired surrogates,
     * but those values are not to be associated with the lead surrogate code *points*.
