     * Tests if the character always has a normalization boundary before it,
     * regardless of context.
     * If true, then the character does not normalization-interact with
     * preceding characters.
     * In other words, a string containing this character can be normalized
     * by processing portions before this character and starting from this
     * character independently.
     * This is used for iterative normalization. See the class documentation for details.
