   * Adjust a random-access offset so that
   * it points behind a Unicode character.
   * The offset that is passed in points behind
   * any code unit of a code point,
   * while the returned offset will point behind the last code unit
   * of the same code point.
   * In UTF-16, if the input offset points behind the first surrogate
   * (i.e., to the second surrogate)
   * of a surrogate pair, then the returned offset will point
   * behind the second surrogate (i.e., to the first surrogate).
   * @param offset a valid offset after any code unit of a code point of the text
   * @return offset of the first code unit after the same code point
