<doc f='include/unicode/numfmt.h' l='866'>/**
     * Unregister a previously-registered NumberFormatFactory using the key returned from the
     * register call.  Key becomes invalid after a successful call and should not be used again.
     * The NumberFormatFactory corresponding to the key will be deleted.
     * Because ICU may choose to cache NumberFormat objects internally,
     * this should be called during application shutdown, after all calls to
     * NumberFormat::createInstance to avoid undefined behavior.
     * @param key the registry key returned by a previous call to registerFactory
     * @param status the in/out status code, no special meanings are assigned
     * @return TRUE if the factory for the key was successfully unregistered
     * @stable ICU 2.6
