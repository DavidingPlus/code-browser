       *  @brief Attempts to insert a std::pair into the %map.
       *  @param  __position  An iterator that serves as a hint as to where the
       *                    pair should be inserted.
       *  @param  __x  Pair to be inserted (see std::make_pair for easy creation
       *               of pairs).
       *  @return An iterator that points to the element with key of
       *           @a __x (may or may not be the %pair passed in).
       *

       *  This function is not concerned about whether the insertion
       *  took place, and thus does not return a boolean like the
       *  single-argument insert() does.  Note that the first
       *  parameter is only a hint and can potentially improve the
       *  performance of the insertion process.  A bad hint would
       *  cause no gains in efficiency.
       *
       *  See
       *  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/associative.html#containers.associative.insert_hints
       *  for more on @a hinting.
       *
       *  Insertion requires logarithmic time (if the hint is not taken).
