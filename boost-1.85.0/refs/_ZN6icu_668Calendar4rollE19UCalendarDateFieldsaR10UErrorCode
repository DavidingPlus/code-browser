     * Time Field Rolling function. Rolls (up/down) a single unit of time on the given
     * time field. For example, to roll the current date up by one day, call
     * roll(Calendar::DATE, true). When rolling on the year or Calendar::YEAR field, it
     * will roll the year value in the range between getMinimum(Calendar::YEAR) and the
     * value returned by getMaximum(Calendar::YEAR). When rolling on the month or
     * Calendar::MONTH field, other fields like date might conflict and, need to be
     * changed. For instance, rolling the month up on the date 01/31/96 will result in
     * 02/29/96. Rolling up always means rolling forward in time (unless the limit of the
     * field is reached, in which case it may pin or wrap), so for Gregorian calendar,
     * starting with 100 BC and rolling the year up results in 99 BC.
     * When eras have a definite beginning and end (as in the Chinese calendar, or as in
     * most eras in the Japanese calendar) then rolling the year past either limit of the
     * era will cause the year to wrap around. When eras only have a limit at one end,
     * then attempting to roll the year past that limit will result in pinning the year
     * at that limit. Note that for most calendars in which era 0 years move forward in
     * time (such as Buddhist, Hebrew, or Islamic), it is possible for add or roll to
     * result in negative years for era 0 (that is the only way to represent years before
     * the calendar epoch).
     * When rolling on the hour-in-day or Calendar::HOUR_OF_DAY field, it will roll the
     * hour value in the range between 0 and 23, which is zero-based.
     * &lt;P&gt;
     * NOTE: Do not use this method -- use roll(UCalendarDateFields, int, UErrorCode&amp;) instead.
     *
     * @param field   The time field.
     * @param up      Indicates if the value of the specified time field is to be rolled
     *                up or rolled down. Use true if rolling up, false otherwise.
     * @param status  Output param set to success/failure code on exit. If any value
     *                previously set in the time field is invalid or restricted by
     *                leniency, this will be set to an error status.
     * @stable ICU 2.6.
