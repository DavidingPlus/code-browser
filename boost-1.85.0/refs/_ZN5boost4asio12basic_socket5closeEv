   * This function is used to close the socket. Any asynchronous send, receive
   * or connect operations will be cancelled immediately, and will complete
   * with the boost::asio::error::operation_aborted error.
   *
   * @throws boost::system::system_error Thrown on failure. Note that, even if
   * the function indicates an error, the underlying descriptor is closed.
   *
   * @note For portable behaviour with respect to graceful closure of a
   * connected socket, call shutdown() before closing the socket.
