  // wondering why it is never called by Google Test.  The declaration of
  // the following method is solely for catching such an error at
  // compile time:
  //
  //   - The return type is deliberately chosen to be not void, so it
  //   will be a conflict if void Setup() is declared in the user&apos;s
  //   test fixture.
  //
  //   - This method is private, so it will be another compiler error
  //   if the method is called from the user&apos;s test fixture.
  //
  // DO NOT OVERRIDE THIS FUNCTION.
  //
  // If you see an error about overriding the following function or
  // about it being private, you have mis-spelled SetUp() as Setup().</doc>
