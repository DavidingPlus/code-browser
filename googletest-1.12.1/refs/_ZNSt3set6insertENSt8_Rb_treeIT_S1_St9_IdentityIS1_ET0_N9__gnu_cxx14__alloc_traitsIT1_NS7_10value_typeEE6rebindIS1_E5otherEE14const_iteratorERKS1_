       *  @brief Attempts to insert an element into the %set.
       *  @param  __position  An iterator that serves as a hint as to where the
       *                    element should be inserted.
       *  @param  __x  Element to be inserted.
       *  @return An iterator that points to the element with key of
       *           @a __x (may or may not be the element passed in).
       *
       *  This function is not concerned about whether the insertion took place,
       *  and thus does not return a boolean like the single-argument insert()
       *  does.  Note that the first parameter is only a hint and can
       *  potentially improve the performance of the insertion process.  A bad
       *  hint would cause no gains in efficiency.
       *
       *  For more on @a hinting, see:
       *  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/associative.html#containers.associative.insert_hints
       *
       *  Insertion requires logarithmic time (if the hint is not taken).
