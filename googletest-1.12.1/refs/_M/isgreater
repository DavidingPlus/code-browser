<doc f='include/math.h' l='1208'>/* ISO C99 defines some macros to compare number while taking care for
   unordered numbers.  Many FPUs provide special instructions to support
   these operations.  Generic support in GCC for these as builtins went
   in 2.97, but not all cpus added their patterns until 3.1.  Therefore
   we enable the builtins from 3.1 onwards and use a generic implementation
   othwerwise.  */</doc>
