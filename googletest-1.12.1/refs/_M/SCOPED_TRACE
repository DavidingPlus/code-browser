// The message argument can be anything streamable to std::ostream.

// In the implementation, we include the current line number as part

// Assuming that each thread maintains its own stack of traces.
// Therefore, a SCOPED_TRACE() would (correctly) only affect the
// assertions in its own thread.</doc>
