  // the corresponding method in ActionInterface is not.  The reason
  // is that a const Action&lt;F&gt; means that it cannot be re-bound to
  // another concrete action, not that the concrete action it binds to
  // cannot change state.  (Think of the difference between a const
  // pointer and a pointer to const.)</doc>
