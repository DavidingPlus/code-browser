// can be streamed.

// This macro is for implementing ASSERT/EXPECT_DEBUG_DEATH when compiled in
// NDEBUG mode. In this case we need the statements to be executed and the macro
// must accept a streamed message even though the message is never printed.
// The regex object is not evaluated, but it is used to prevent &quot;unused&quot;
// warnings and to avoid an expression that doesn&apos;t compile in debug mode.</doc>
