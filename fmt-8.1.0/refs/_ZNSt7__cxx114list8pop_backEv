       *  @brief  Removes last element.
       *
       *  This is a typical stack operation.  It shrinks the %list by
       *  one.  Due to the nature of a %list this operation can be done
       *  in constant time, and only invalidates iterators/references to
       *  the element being removed.
       *
       *  Note that no data is returned, and if the last element&apos;s data
       *  is needed, it should be retrieved before pop_back() is called.
