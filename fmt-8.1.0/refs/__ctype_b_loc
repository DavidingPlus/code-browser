   The declarations here must match those in localeinfo.h.

   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale&apos; in &lt;locale.h&gt;)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char&apos; value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char&apos; value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char&apos; values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char&apos; values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int&apos;s
   rather than `unsigned char&apos;s because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn&apos;t fit into an `unsigned char&apos;.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  */</doc>
