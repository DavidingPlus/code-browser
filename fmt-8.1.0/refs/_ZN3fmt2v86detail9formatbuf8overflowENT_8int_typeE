<doc f='fmt-8.1.0/include/fmt/format.h' l='282'>// The put area is always empty. This makes the implementation simpler and has
  // the advantage that the streambuf and the buffer are always in sync and
  // sputc never writes into uninitialized memory. A disadvantage is that each
  // call to sputc always results in a (virtual) call to overflow. There is no
  // disadvantage here for sputn since this always results in a call to xsputn.</doc>
