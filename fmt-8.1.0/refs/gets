   This function is impossible to use safely.  It has been officially
   removed from ISO C11 and ISO C++14, and we have also removed it
   from the _GNU_SOURCE feature list.  It remains available when
   explicitly using an old ISO C, Unix, or POSIX standard.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
