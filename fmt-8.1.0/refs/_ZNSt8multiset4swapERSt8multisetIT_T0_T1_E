       *  @brief  Swaps data with another %multiset.
       *  @param  __x  A %multiset of the same element and allocator types.
       *
       *  This exchanges the elements between two multisets in constant time.
       *  (It is only swapping a pointer, an integer, and an instance of the @c
       *  Compare type (which itself is often stateless and empty), so it should
       *  be quite fast.)
       *  Note that the global std::swap() function is specialized such that
       *  std::swap(s1,s2) will feed to this function.
       *
       *  Whether the allocators are swapped depends on the allocator traits.
